And even today, after all her achievements, this woman is&nbsp;living proof that success never comes easy and that every day is&nbsp;a&nbsp;new challenge that we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;conquer.</p><p><h2>She was Gianni’s biggest muse</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4a/437/4b969353a3a85b81a5ea4006ba.jpg><p>No&nbsp;one can argue that Versace is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;fashion’s biggest and most luxurious brands, but first and foremost this family’s story shows&nbsp;us the importance of&nbsp;family values.</p><p>The story of&nbsp;this fashion empire <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> with designer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gianni Versace</a>, who grew up&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;his mom, who was a&nbsp;dressmaker. In&nbsp;1978, at&nbsp;32&nbsp;years old, Gianni established his own company with his brother Santo as&nbsp;CEO, and his sister Donatella as&nbsp;a&nbsp;designer and vice president.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8b/3c6/0f0e035cc7a4b5e418726edafa.jpg><p>The relationship between Gianni and Donatella, who is&nbsp;8&nbsp;years his junior, was always so&nbsp;special. She was his closest adviser, most trustworthy friend, and biggest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>muse</a>. He&nbsp;was also the one who advised her to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dye</a> her hair platinum blonde, a&nbsp;look that became her forever iconic trademark. Gianni even once declared, “If&nbsp;I&nbsp;were to&nbsp;marry, I&nbsp;would look for a&nbsp;girl like Donatella.”</p><p><h2>When tragedy struck</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c6f/c89/0dc4cf547088ad44f808616b05.jpg><p>In&nbsp;September 1997, the most unthinkable tragedy struck when Gianni’s life horribly and suddenly ended. The designer was 50&nbsp;years old. Needless to&nbsp;say that his little sister was beyond devastated. Looking back, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “My&nbsp;brother was the king, and my&nbsp;whole world had crashed around&nbsp;me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/316/7f3/1c2cdc51c3af883d8166bdc4f0.jpg><p>Following Gianni’s tragedy, it&nbsp;was declared that Donatella would assume creative control of&nbsp;Versace. The then 42-year-old felt extremely overwhelmed by&nbsp;this heavy responsibility, and her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>insecurities</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;designer made her not feel ready to&nbsp;carry this burden. She herself admitted, “For the first 5&nbsp;years, I&nbsp;was lost,” She noted, “I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;mistakes.”</p><p><h2>She had to&nbsp;conquer her demons</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a01/00e/71010c51e4b19b842377029025.jpg><p>With fame and fortune in&nbsp;one hand and her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>self-critical</a> nature in&nbsp;the other, Donatella gave in&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;temptations and distractions in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;deal with the pressures that came with her position. This eventually made her life spiral out of&nbsp;control.</p><p>However, a&nbsp;few years later, the designer realized that she had to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;herself and her capabilities and take control of&nbsp;the future of&nbsp;the empire. Otherwise, her beloved brother’s legacy would be&nbsp;in&nbsp;serious danger.</p><p><h2>Finding her own voice</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b3/ab7/68ab0a53febd294d0c8251c258.jpg><p>And luckily, Donatella ended up&nbsp;finding her true voice and identity in&nbsp;the fashion world. Because at&nbsp;the start of&nbsp;her career, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;follow in&nbsp;his footsteps. But it&nbsp;was not exactly my&nbsp;style.”</p><p>Thinking back on&nbsp;her first challenging years, she’d <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>advise</a> herself to&nbsp;“Be&nbsp;strong, and stay true to&nbsp;yourself... But most of&nbsp;all, follow your own instincts, and don’t try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Gianni.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/924/53d/321a0f5e03b6c5bdeb7efcb6d6.jpg><p>The 3&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>elements</a> that set her creations apart from her brothers’ were the use of&nbsp;less bright colors, less revealing clothes, and less decoration. And needless to&nbsp;say that it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;courage for Donatella to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, being a&nbsp;woman who is&nbsp;designing for women made Donatella “understand exactly what women want to&nbsp;wear.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/109/576/14e56658b8a3c3ee13966c9f8d.jpg><p>With her, Versace <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> all about female empowerment. She declared, “We&nbsp;need more women CEOs. Women becoming top models, that’s not enough.”</p><p>And she tries to&nbsp;convey her vision through the clothes that she designs. She believes that women should feel comfortable in&nbsp;their clothes whether they are a&nbsp;size 38&nbsp;or 46. And this means that, for her, fashion is&nbsp;all about the right fit.</p><p><h2>Preserving the Versace legacy and thriving</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfc/bdc/545d7459939ddd2c77ce14eb43.jpg><p>And this approach seems to&nbsp;have been working perfectly for decades now.&nbsp;25&nbsp;years after becoming the creative director of&nbsp;Versace, this name is&nbsp;still one of&nbsp;the biggest luxury brands in&nbsp;the fashion industry. The brand continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;favorite on&nbsp;the <a href=# title="red carpet" data-link=tag>red carpet</a> and among celebrities&nbsp;— recently she designed Britney Spears’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wedding dress</a>.</p><p><h2>The beauty and the challenge of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;woman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aea/a9f/d1884a515b8345d2fac201f619.jpg><p>Donatella acknowledges that staying at&nbsp;the top requires continuous work and endless devotion, especially when you’re a&nbsp;woman trying to&nbsp;progress in&nbsp;a&nbsp;man’s world.</p><p>The 67-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a>, ’’Everything is&nbsp;more difficult for a&nbsp;woman. We&nbsp;can’t compare a&nbsp;man’s experience in&nbsp;the workplace to&nbsp;what women have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through.’’ She explains that women ’’are more likely to&nbsp;get scrutinized and criticized than men.’’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bdf/135/6fe4b45cd1ba31f22cdc0ed6db.jpg><p>Donatella Versace, creative director, opens up&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, ’’My fashion’s fearless. I’m not. I’m very insecure.’’</p><p>Yet regardless of&nbsp;all her fears and the hurdles that she has to&nbsp;constantly face, Donatella Versace’s success story is&nbsp;the biggest proof that when we&nbsp;have the determination to&nbsp;succeed, nothing is&nbsp;impossible. And the more we&nbsp;have challenges on&nbsp;our path, the sweeter the taste of&nbsp;success becomes once we&nbsp;overcome them.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;Donatella Versace’s journey?
