That person is most commonly their spouse or romantic partner (67% of people who do have a confidant said this). Men are slightly more likely than women to give this answer (71% versus 64%). This is possibly a factor of mortality: the difference is most pronounced over the age of 60 (73% of men versus 54% of women) and women tend to live longer than men, and so may have given this answer because they have outlived their partner.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Who20can20open20up20to-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>A majority of people with at least one confidant (56%) said they had a friend they could talk to. Here the gender results are reversed, with 62% of women having a friend they can turn to but only 48% of men saying the same.</p><p>Women of all ages are roughly as likely to say they have a friend they can confide in (55% among 18 to 29 year olds, then between 62% and 65% among all older age groups). But for men the number sadly declines as they get older.</p><p>While 63% of men aged from 18 to 29 say they have a friend they can confide in, this figure falls to 50% among 30 to 44 year olds and subsequently to 42% among those aged 60 and above. This could reflect a reluctance among older generations of men to be open about their feelings with their pals.</p><p>The third most common type of person people feel they can confide in is a parent. Three in ten (30%) of those who feel they have someone they can confide in say that person is a parent. Unsurprisingly this answer is given less frequently as people get older – doubtless because their parents have passed away.</p><p>Women feel more able to confide in children than men (23% versus 11%). While this answer is virtually non-existent among 18 to 24 year olds, the gap is especially wide amongst the oldest Brits – those aged 65 and above – of whom 49% of women feel they can confide in a child compared to only 25% of men.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhqY2V%2FdHnOp5xmnpmrsm6u0aKrqKajYrWiwsRmpaian5nGbrvPnqVmmZKkwrV5z6umm6SVosA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-mescal-nude-scenes-normal-people-tv-show-1234598927.html><span>←</span><span>Normal People Heartthrob Paul Mescal Answers All Your Burning Questions About Connell</span></a>
