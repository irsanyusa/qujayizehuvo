Musk has vowed to ensure that the site becomes a space for free speech, tweeting it is the “bedrock of a functioning democracy”. But what do the British public think of Musk’s takeover?</p><p data-block-key=w338u>By 40% to 23%, Britons have an unfavourable view of Elon Musk personally, though 37% don’t know enough about him to give an opinion either way. He is also unpopular with Twitter users, with 49% holding a negative opinion of him compared to 27% with a positive view.</p><p data-block-key=nm2mg>The vast majority of Twitter users (90%) are aware of the ongoing sale, and by 30% to 14% users believe this will be a bad rather than good thing for the platform (32% vs 14% among those who use the platform on a daily basis). A quarter of those who use the platform (24%) don’t think it would make much difference either way. The study was conducted prior to Musk saying he <a href=#>would introduce minor costs</a> for commercial or government users.</p><p data-block-key=zvnh0>When it comes to Musk’s promises to facilitate more free speech, his ideas do not necessarily align with what the British public, or British Twitter users, want. Only 11% of the public and 14% of Twitter users think the site currently doesn’t give people enough freedom to post what they want. By contrast, more than twice as many people (32% of Britons and 37% of Twitter users) think that Twitter already gives <i>too much</i> freedom, allowing too much harmful and offensive content. One in six Britons (17%) and one in four users (27%) think the platform has the balance about right.</p><p data-block-key=vzs64>Looking across the pond, the takeover is <a href=#>being viewed slightly more postively in America</a> than it is in the UK. As news of the sale was breaking, 30% of the US public thought it would be good for Twitter compared to 24% saying it would be bad. Elon Musk himself is also far more popular in the United States, with 49% holding a favourable view of him compared to 31% an unfavourable one.</p><p data-block-key=to6c7><b>See full results </b><a href=#><b>here</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwaavx6empaeXrnyivtOimqWdo2SBc3%2BVbGSwoJGpeqW7jK2uoqykmr9uwdKeqaxlpJ22r7eMnqOopl2iwrS3jJussqGenHqxuMCtnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-guinguette-avec-des-produits-locaux-dans-le-tarn-81.html><span>←</span><span>Une guinguette avec des produits locaux dans le Tarn (81)</span></a>
