Tootling his saxophone in London’s Bond Street, Aubyn Rayinski, a Russian emigré, was commanded by Constable John Wells to take his noise elsewhere. Rayinski, who knows his rights, retorted: “I am a great artist. I must give my public satisfaction. I do not intend to move.” A few days later, in Great Marlborough Street court, Rayinski was fined 5 shillings (70¢) for “blowing a noisy instrument for the purpose of obtaining alms,” but made it clear that he considered a great injustice had been done."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He filed an appeal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last week, Rayinski marched into court with his saxophone (in case proof were needed of his talent), a briefcase (stuffed with documents setting forth the legal rights of street musicians) and a big display board on which was tacked a postcard which read: “You are certainly the most extraordinary virtuoso since Paganini … If you can stop the abominable jazzers’ practice of playing the saxophone as con sordino [i.e., muted] and as disorderly as possible, you will be a great benefactor as well as a great player.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The postcard was signed by a onetime music critic, George Bernard Shaw, who had had a long talk with Rayinski one day after hearing him play outside Shaw’s house in Ayot Saint Lawrence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In last week’s hearing, Rayinski’s counsel pointed out that the 1839 law under which the musician had been convicted provided that householders could call the cops and complain if street music became obnoxious; in Rayinski’s case no such complaint had been registered. The court reversed the conviction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Said Rayinski: “Today is a great victory for my art. Now I shall go on playing.
