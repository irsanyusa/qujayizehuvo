Sader tells&nbsp;us that he&nbsp;remembers feeling very loved as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child and <strong>his father would spend time with him wrestling, thumb wrestling, and playing other games</strong>. The local community also supported the family and accepted them as&nbsp;they are.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;worked hard so&nbsp;his son could achieve his dreams.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e68/613/c4e2775c33a7fb083ea21df82d.jpg><p>Having big dreams for his son, Jad, who used to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wheat mill, started saving money for his college tuition. He&nbsp;did everything in&nbsp;his power to&nbsp;support his family and, according to&nbsp;Sader, <strong>his father’s hard work and commitment to&nbsp;giving him the best future possible inspired him to&nbsp;study arduously</strong> and become a&nbsp;doctor. “I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I would’ve been much less excited about life and much less passionate about what I&nbsp;do if&nbsp;I didn’t have my&nbsp;special father,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> captioning a&nbsp;photo with his dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/111/bc6/6ea99c5f96bf122f8c283f0829.jpg><p><h2>He’s extremely proud of&nbsp;his doctor son.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95b/c72/166f0759dcac8e1304d2221f1a.jpg><p>Sader is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;dentist, which is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best and high paying careers in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Syria</a>, and Jad’s <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> has no&nbsp;bounds. When his son was still studying, Jad would introduce new people to&nbsp;him by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>telling</a> them <strong>“my&nbsp;son is&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor” with a&nbsp;twinkle in&nbsp;his eyes</strong>.</p><p><h2>The family is&nbsp;living proof that stereotypes are meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;broken.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f41/959/f511e7509fa63dcc075080527c.jpg><p>Talking about the relationship his parents share, Sader told&nbsp;us that despite being together for decades, <strong>the love between his mom and dad is&nbsp;still as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were married yesterday</strong>. They understand each other’s needs perfectly. They love to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;walks together and sometimes they just sit and chat away for hours.</p><p>Sader gives the credit behind his success to&nbsp;his father and admits he&nbsp;is&nbsp;as&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;his dad as&nbsp;his dad is&nbsp;of&nbsp;him. The inspiring duo loves catching up&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> together in&nbsp;their free time.</p><p>Know someone who would love to&nbsp;read the heartwarming story of&nbsp;Jad and his son as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;did?
