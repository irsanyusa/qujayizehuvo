We’re very close. I remain prayerful for him. Of other things which I didn’t succeed, God has given him the opportunity to do it and succeed.</p><p>“For me…if there is anything pending, governance, governance you don’t finish. People are still in government in America. So, you stop where you stop. Other people will continue from there. I don’t look back. He is the governor of my state. He is my senior brother. He is even more intelligent than I am. He is a professor and I am a trader. He knows more.</p><p>So, he will be able to do this better than I’m doing it. I have done my little work as a trader. Now the professor is there, he will do his own thing as a professor. The schools that I didn’t roof, you roof them. That’s our government goes.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On the claim that his investments for Anambra are now worthless, Obi said the company is still doing well.</p><p>He said, “When you spread your investment, some will go up, some will come down. But overall, the company is still there. The company is still doing well. It’s still part of a global chain and everything. I needed to explain it not because I’m defending comments made by my brother.”</p><p>Obi dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) six months ago for the Labour Party and emerged as the presidential candidate of the LP barely a month after his defection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46irZ5llKS7pnnMsmSjp5JirrR506uYnZ2iYrGwediorKurXZbAbrzRqJ2eq6Okv267waJkq52gobamv4yspqWtlKR8urzLcKSqpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-spoof-videos-memes-help-fracking-supporters-win-young-voters.html><span>←</span><span>Can a Spoof Video Help Fracking Supporters Win Over Young Voters?</span></a>
