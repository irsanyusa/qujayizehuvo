Rather than chasing the usual thrills of&nbsp;youth, like friendships, romance, and personal ambitions, he&nbsp;has chosen a&nbsp;different path, one of&nbsp;commitment to&nbsp;family.</p><p>From his earliest days, Punsalan’s grandma was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>constant source</a> of&nbsp;love and support. Now, as&nbsp;she enters her golden years and needs him most, Punsalan is&nbsp;returning the favor with unwavering devotion and tenderness.

Though it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wasn’t</a> easy to&nbsp;see his once-strong grandmother become fragile and dependent, Punsalan rose to&nbsp;the challenge, becoming her primary caregiver without hesitation.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;shows that love wins over every obstacle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3fd/466/2b1bc25fc29076fec365874ee7.png><p>Despite the initial challenges, Punsalan has adapted well to&nbsp;his role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;caregiver and has grown to&nbsp;love his job. His grandmother’s grateful and loving nature has made it&nbsp;all the more rewarding, as&nbsp;she always takes the time to&nbsp;thank others for their kindness.</p><p>“She can’t move and she’s bound to&nbsp;her bed.
