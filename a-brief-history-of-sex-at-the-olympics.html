(Because while it’s ok to <a href=# rel=noopener>allude to the deed by sexifying female athletes</a>, the idea that anyone’s having any actual sex is a different thing completely.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We’ve rounded up a history of how sex at Olympic village has been covered over the last few decades. And judging by the florid prose in the dispatches below, the journalists seem to be pretty overheated as well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Sochi 2014</strong>:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The games have just begun, but it’s already the year of Tinder and talk of <a href=# rel=noopener>100,000 condoms circulating around the Olympic Village.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>London 2012:</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The London Olympics probably saw the most headlines regarding athlete-on-athlete sexcapades. <a href=# rel=noopener>“Gay app Grindr crashes as Olympic athletes arrive in London,”</a> read the Mirror. “<a href=# rel=noopener>Could London 2012 be the raunchiest games ever</a>?” asked the Daily Mail. <a href=# rel=noopener>“Steamy London Olympics: A Condom-a-Day, Per Athlete,”</a> wrote Businessweek of the 150,000 condoms distributed. <a href=# rel=noopener>“Who Will Win the Sex Olympics?”</a> questioned Forbes — Durex was the right answer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Althletes were particularly candid about their sex lives, as well. “I’ve seen people having sex right out in the open,” <a href=# rel=noopener>U.S. soccer star Hope Solo told ESPN in a long expose of Olympians’ sexual encounters.</a> “On the grass, between buildings, people are getting down and dirty.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ryan Lochte said: “My last Olympics, I had a girlfriend — big mistake.

Olympic athletes have to display an unnatural… level of self-discipline in the build-up to big competitions. How else is this going to manifest itself than with a volcanic release of pent-up hedonism.” This led to a headlines asserting that the Olympic Village hosted <a href=# rel=noopener>“More Sex than Woodstock.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Page Six discussed</a> Michael Phelps “celebrated his record-breaking eight gold medals in Beijing by sneaking off for a sizzling game of tonsil hockey with one of Australia’s hottest Olympians.” (She was his <a href=# rel=noopener>girlfriend</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Oh, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Beijing authorities distributed 400,000 condoms</a> to more than 400 hotels in the Olympic city, said the AFP.

They had to send out for 20,000 more after a week.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Javelin thrower <a href=# rel=noopener>Breaux Greer told ESPN</a> that he had relations with three women every day of the Olympics — two were other Olympians and another was a tourist. He had to leave the games due to a knee injury. But as a consolation prize, he did end up with a famous (unnamed) Olympian in the airplane bathroom on the flight back to Los Angeles.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Norway 1994:</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Skier Carrie Sheinberg told ESPN</a> that two German bobsledders “made it clear that they’d trade me their gold for all kinds of other favors.
