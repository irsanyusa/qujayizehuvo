Celia María Cuccittini and her husband struggled financially when their son Lionel was young.</p><p><h2>Growing up, Messi faced a&nbsp;challenging situation as&nbsp;he&nbsp;dealt with a&nbsp;medical condition.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/eab/3a4/ad27d95636a96ea169c65edc00.jpeg><p>Lionel suffered from a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>growth hormone deficiency</a>, and the treatment for it&nbsp;was very expensive, almost using up&nbsp;all of&nbsp;their earnings. Thankfully, FC&nbsp;Barcelona stepped in&nbsp;and offered to&nbsp;cover the cost of&nbsp;Lionel’s medical treatment. This generous offer led Celia and her family to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;Spain for their son’s care.</p><p>However, the stay of&nbsp;Celia, Lionel, and his siblings in&nbsp;the European country was short-lived. Celia later returned to&nbsp;Argentina, leaving her son and husband behind. Lionel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>: <strong>“It&nbsp;was very tough for&nbsp;me.

Whenever he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;leave them and return to&nbsp;Spain, the soccer player struggled emotionally. Lionel’s father, Jorge Messi, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “Leo needs his mother.”</p><p><h2>The two share a&nbsp;very close bond ever since.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d9/5d0/f1cba250688c5f37d00b107216.jpg><p>Celia María Cuccittini and her son share a&nbsp;close and enduring bond. Despite the physical distance that often separated them during Lionel’s professional career, he&nbsp;found meaningful ways to&nbsp;celebrate special moments with his mother. In&nbsp;2011, after scoring against Racing Santander, Lionel lifted his soccer jersey to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reveal</a> a&nbsp;shirt with a&nbsp;message that read, “Happy birthday, Mom,” in&nbsp;English.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fff/797/39c54c53afb0e73f294f7cfa08.jpg><p>During the same year, he&nbsp;also showed a&nbsp;<a href=# title=tattoo data-link=tag>tattoo</a> of&nbsp;his mother on&nbsp;his shoulder while on&nbsp;vacation. In&nbsp;2022, Celia and her son touched the hearts of&nbsp;many when she rushed onto the pitch to&nbsp;celebrate with him following his FIFA World Cup victory in&nbsp;what was described as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most “dramatic” finals ever.</p><p><h2>Lionel Messi’s mother has always been there for him when he&nbsp;needed her the most.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;the aftermath of&nbsp;what’s been dubbed the most thrilling World Cup final ever, Lionel Messi found himself swarmed by&nbsp;jubilant fans on&nbsp;the pitch. Finally, after all his accomplishments, he&nbsp;had secured the one trophy that had eluded him throughout his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/325/48f/2ed57b51c7acec16efaf5e28a4.jpg><p>Caught on&nbsp;camera, his mother, Celia Maria Cuccittini, wearing an&nbsp;Argentina shirt, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rushed up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him</a>, her eyes filled with tears.
