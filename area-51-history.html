The event, called “<a href=# rel=noopener>Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us</a>,” is planned for Sept. 20, and so far 1.5 million people have signed on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As far back as the 1950s, people have reported seeing Unidentified Flying Objects (U.F.O.’s) at the southern Nevada military base.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On June 17, 1959, the Reno Evening Gazette published a story with the headline “More Flying Objects Seen In Clark Sky,” and described how Sgt. Wayne Anderson of the local sheriff’s office was among several locals to spot what the paper described as an object “bright green in color and descending toward the earth at a speed too great to be an airplane.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>According to the CIA</a>, secretive flight testing has been happening in the area since the military began testing U-2 CIA spy planes in 1955, around the time reports of U.F.O. sightings started to come out — but that news has done little to quell the otherworldly theories that have long surrounded the enigmatic site.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s everything to know about the history of Area 51, and why more than a million people want to “see them aliens.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is Area 51?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Area 51, officially named the Nevada Test and Training Range at Groom Lake, is a high-security open training range for the U.S. Air Force in southern Nevada — though the site is still very secretive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The public found out that <a href=# rel=noopener>Area 51 officially existed</a> in August 2013 after <a href=# rel=noopener>Dr. Jeffrey T. Richelson</a>, a senior fellow at the George Washington University <a href=# rel=noopener>National Security Archive</a>, submitted a Freedom of Information Act Request in 2005 for information on the CIA’s Lockheed U-2 plane reconnaissance program, the secret construction and testing of spy planes used to gather intelligence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The request forced the CIA to declassify documents on the <a href=# rel=noopener>history of the U-2 and A-12 OXCART </a><a href=# rel=noopener>program</a> and the military base where the planes were constructed and tested — Area 51.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There certainly was — as you would expect — no discussion of little green men here,” Richelson, <a href=# rel=noopener>who died in 2017</a>, told <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> in 2013. “This is a history of the U-2. The only overlap is the discussion of the U-2 flights and U.F.O. sightings, the fact that you had these high-flying aircraft in the air being the cause of some of the sightings.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Malcolm Byrne, Deputy Director and Director of Research at the National Security Archive, tells TIME that Richelson essentially solved the mystery surrounding Area 51 indirectly. “I don’t think Richelson was going after Area 51 specifically, it’s just that as often happens in these things, there’s serendipity and so material gets released that has things of interest for other people.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is the proposed “raid”?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a pinned post on Facebook event’s page, Jackson Barns, who says he created the joke event, details his tongue-in-cheek plan to invade Area 51. It involves Monster energy drinks, “Kyles” (the internet name for white men and boys who have anger issues and punch drywall) and <a href=# rel=noopener>Naruto</a><a href=# rel=noopener>-running, inspired by a Japanese anime show.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Then the Rock Throwers will throw pebbles at the inevitable resistance (we don’t want to hurt them, we just want to annoy them enough to not shoot the kyles as often),” Barns writes, before making it clear that he does not advocate this plan actually coming to fruition. “P.S. Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So far, 1.5 million people from all over the world have signed on to join the “raid,” and the event has inspired a <a href=#>mega-viral meme</a>. Even rapper Lil Nas X released <a href=# rel=noopener>a new music video</a> for his hit “Old Town Road” that features cowboys raiding Area 51.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How has the government responded to the raid?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A spokesperson for the U.S. Air Force told several media outlets that they are aware of the plans to “raid” Area 51 — and are staunchly against them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Any attempt to illegally access the area is highly discouraged,” an Air Force spokesperson told <a href=# rel=noopener>NPR</a> in a Monday statement, along with several other <a href=# rel=noopener>media outlets.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“[Area 51] is an open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces,” Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Washington Post</a>. “The U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Air Force did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why has Area 51 become the subject of so many conspiracy theories?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Sgt. Anderson told the Reno Evening Gazette (now known as the Reno Gazette-Journal) about spotting a U.F.O. back in 1959, the outlet also reported that the Nellis Air Force Base, located about 130 miles south of Area 51, had received two previous reports in the past three weeks of U.F.O. sightings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those reports came just a few years after rumors of a U.F.O. crashing in <a href=# rel=noopener>Roswell, New Mexico</a> in 1947, which the Roswell Army Air Field later said was a weather balloon. The <a href=# rel=noopener>Air Force began investigating claims of U.F.O. sightings</a> in 1947, which later became known as <a href=# rel=noopener>Project Blue Book</a> in 1952. By the time Project Blue Book ended in 1969, the Air Force had investigated over 12,000 claims.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, people in the southern Nevada region continued to report U.F.O. sightings, which in hindsight were probably sightings of the top-secret spy planes being constructed. Even so, imaginations have run wild ever since.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Area 51 references have also seeped into pop culture, making appearances in movies like Independence Day and Paul.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It has also inspired episodes of The Twilight Zone and The X-Files, as well as the slightly less iconic straight-to-video film Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubmJsg3qAjpqpnpldan5utMisq6iqqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charli-xcx-calls-out-fans-chanting-taylor-swift-is-dead-15224.html><span>←</span><span>Charli XCX Calls Out Fans Chanting 'Taylor Swift Is Dead'</span></a>
