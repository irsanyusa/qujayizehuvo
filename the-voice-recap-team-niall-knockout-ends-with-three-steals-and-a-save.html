The standout from this week’s episode was the three-way Knockout on Niall Horan’s team, which ended with all three artists staying in the competition thanks to a steal and a save.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-team-niall-knockout-ends-with-steals-save>The Voice Team Niall Knockout Ends with Steals, Save</h2><p>We got to see Monday’s Team Niall Knockout ahead of time, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it was an early release clip</a>. But we didn’t know how it would turn out. Thankfully, all three artists ended up staying in the competition, with one going to another team.</p><p>First up was Claudia B., who sang a soulful rendition of “Don’t Know Why” by Norah Jones. She was up against Huntley with a powerhouse cover of “Wanted Dead or Alive” by Bon Jovi, as well as Noah Spencer with an acoustic version of “Where Rainbows Never Die” by The SteelDrivers.</p><p>Horan said it was the “best Knockout I’ve ever seen on this show.” Ultimately, he chose Huntley as the Knockout winner. However, he hit his button to save Claudia from elimination. Legend also hit his steal button to hopefully get her back on his team after losing her in the Battles. Claudia chose to stay on Team Niall.</p><p>When it came time for Noah to leave the competition, both Legend and Reba McEntire hit their buttons to steal him. He decided that he wanted to join Team Reba heading into the Live Playoffs next week.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET UPCOMING ‘THE VOICE’ COUNTRY COACH DUO DAN + SHAY</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-legend-hits-his-steal-button-three-times>John Legend Hits His Steal Button Three Times</h3><p>Legend had both a save and a steal still available going into Monday’s show. During the episode, he hit his steal button for three different artists. The third time was the charm, as he got Kristen Brown on his team after her Knockout on Team Gwen.</p><p>Kristen got emotional in her performance of “This One’s for the Girls” by Martina McBride. She was up against Kara Tenae with “Leave (Get Out)” by JoJo and CORii with “Ain’t It Fun” by Paramore. Ultimately, Gwen Stefani chose to keep Kara on her team. CORii was sadly eliminated, but Kristen earned a steal from Legend.</p><p>Earlier in the show, Stefani stole one of Legend’s artists, Stee. He sang “Pretty Wings” by Maxwell in a Knockout against Deejay Young and Lila Forde. Legend chose Lila as the winner for her performance of “Fire and Rain” by James Taylor.</p><p>What did you think of Monday’s show?
