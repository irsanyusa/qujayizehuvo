Her mother attended a Pentecostal church. She told the outlet that it was in her church that she was exposed to art, music, public speaking, and reading.</p><p>She noted that she still worries about the end of the world, as the teachings from the sermons are still ingrained in her head.</p><p>“There was definitely a lot of anxiety about, like, the end of the world. Am I a good person? And I’m probably always worried about the end of the world in a sense. I think when those things are encoded in your DNA, they’ll always be there. It might not be always from the lens of an evangelist, but I think as a human being those are things that I think about, however consciously or subconsciously,” she told the outlet.</p><p>She attended New York University, where she studied Dramatic Writing. Her initial major was Teaching before she made the switch to a more passion-driven course. It was while in school that she met her best friend and longtime collaborator, Rachel Sennott.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Edebiri began her career in the New York stand-up comedy circuit, where she quickly made her mark and has continued to <a href=# id=44140b32-aeef-4569-aba7-33173aabf6f6 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>rise up the ladder of success</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaasZ9isqWxwaKpomWjpbKit9Jmpqdll6e8uLXNoGSuqF2eu26tjKyrq6GTqXqku82snKuukam2t7GMoaamnV2eu26tzJ6popuRZLetgtFppZ0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./date.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened on July 1, 1993</span></a>
