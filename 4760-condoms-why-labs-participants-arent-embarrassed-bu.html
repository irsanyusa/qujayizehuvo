Buying condoms is a public declaration that you want sex and many people still aren't comfortable with that."</a></p><p>Last week in Labs, we wanted to know whether our Labs participants amongst those embarrassed – or those who are not. We also asked them why they think people in the UK are embarrassed to buy condoms, and what could be done to change the situation.</p><h2><b>See what we found…</b></h2><p>Most of Labs participants were <b>not very embarrassed</b> or <b>not at all embarrassed </b>to buy condoms.</p><p>Fewer participants said they did feel embarrassed when purchasing condoms. See participants’ comments below.</p><h2><b>Male participants who were not embarrassed to buy condoms</b></h2><ul><li><h3><b>A recurring opinion emerged, stating that participants buying condoms is a ‘mark of pride’, not something to be uncomfortable about:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“Why should the cashier care? I see it almost as a <b>mark of pride</b>” </i>Inverness</p><p><i>“We all know what they are for, so why be embarrassed? We should <b>be proud that we’re having safe sex</b>”</i> Robert Portland Dorset</p><p><i>“<b>What is there to be embarrassed about</b>? "I'm going to have sex", that's pretty <b>natural</b>. "I'm not going to have kids as a result", that's <b>great</b>! The <b>majority of the population has sex</b>, why be <b>embarrassed to be part of this group</b>?” </i>Anon<i></i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Many argued that sex is a completely natural part of our lives, and buying condoms should be seen as just as natural</b>.</h3></li></ul><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/CondomBoy.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><i>“Sex is a <b>completely natural part of life</b>, <b>buying condoms is just like buying food</b>”</i> Greg, Kent</p><p><i>“It's <b>natural</b> to have sex”</i> Darren, London</p><p><i>“Why would I be? Sex is <b>part of life</b>”</i> Anon</p><ul><li><h3><b>Many participants thought it was normal to buy condoms, and if you are an adult, you should not be embarrassed:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“I am a <b>confident adult</b>. If they are selling them <b>why should I be embarrassed</b> [to buy them]?”</i> Ealingguy, London</p><ul><li><h3><b>Some participants outlined that it was for a good cause – for the good of the health, and the responsible thing to do, not something to be ashamed of:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“Well, it is <b>better to be safe than sorry</b>, not sure why anyone would be embarrassed to buy something they will be <b>using for the good of their health</b>”</i> Anon</p><p><i>“Why should one be embarrassed? It is the <b>responsible</b> thing to do, rather than having <b>unprotected sex</b> and <b>nobody should feel the least embarrassed</b> by being seen to <b>do the right thing</b>”</i> Liam, Derry<i></i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Some said that buying condoms is not embarrassing, yet they get embarrassed if people see them browsing or choosing from a variety of options:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“I <b>don't see buying condoms as something to be embarrassed</b> about.

We usually <b>hide</b> this statement, or <b>wrap</b> it up with lots of <b>jokes and euphemisms</b>” </i>Anon</p><h2><b>Female participants who were not embarrassed to buy condoms</b></h2><ul><li><h3><b>More female participants said they were not embarrassed to buy condoms, than embarrassed. Many believed that buying condoms is normal and that it doesn’t actually imply that one is sleeping around:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“It's a <b>normal thing</b>, plus it's <b>possible to be in a relationship</b> and <b>buy condoms regularly</b> so it <b>doesn't mean you're sleeping around</b>. Not that the shop assistants care anyway”</i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Similarly to male participants, female Labs participants also said buying condoms should be something we are proud, not ashamed, of:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“If anything, it's kind of <b>showing off to the person at the till</b>. It’s not like you should be ashamed you’re having sex, <b>surely you should be proud of it</b>. It's not like you're buying something more risqué like a sex toy, <b>condoms are very common</b>!” </i>Tamsin, Edinburgh</p><ul><li><h3><b>Female participants also outlined the health factor and said that buying condoms is the responsible thing to do.

It would be <b>embarrassing if you caught a disease from not wearing one</b>, so <b>better safe than sorry</b>!” Una, Cardiff</i></p><p><i>“I am <b>not embarrassed</b> as I think it should be <b>looked upon as taking responsibility</b> of <b>unwanted child</b> or <b>risk of infection</b>” </i>Sue<i></i></p><p><i>“It shows I am <b>being</b> a <b>responsible adult</b>” Annie, Surrey</i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Just like male participants, female participants said sex is a perfectly normal thing, and buying condoms is something everyone needs to do:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“I <b>don't really understand why people are embarrassed by it</b>! I think that <b>sex is a very normal and natural thing</b> that the <b>majority</b> of people do, so why get embarrassed about buying something that <b>pretty much everyone needs to buy</b>?”</i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Some female participants said that buying condoms sends out a positive message of being desirable and sensible:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“I certainly <b>don't feel embarrassed buying condoms</b>. It makes me feel t<b>he message is that I'm desirable</b> (it is <b>indicating</b> that I'm <b>in a relationship and having regular sex</b>).

I think it is <b>part of a wider problem of not being able to talk about sex</b> and being ashamed of wanting and having sex” </i>Anon<i></i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Some participants believed people are embarrassed as they feel they are exposing their private business:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“<b>People knowing your business</b>, it seems a private business” </i>Anon<i></i></p><p><i>“Because it <b>defines something intimate in a person’s life</b>.

It is a <b>private thing</b>, so <b>not talking about your sex lives is perfectly understandable</b>. However, talking about <b>sex in general, sexual health</b>, etc. <b>should be encouraged</b>. I think that it's the <b>"taboo" around sex that in part leads to problems such as the prevalence of STIs and teenage pregnancies</b>. Therefore, to resolve the issue we simply need to talk about sex more!” </i>Anon<i></i></p><p><i>“Children should be <b>taught sex education</b>. Then when they get older <b>it would not be an issue to buy condoms</b>” </i>Sue</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/SexEducation_hqXC9xw.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><i>“We haven't had <b>decent</b>, no-nonsense <b>sex education</b>. If sex was treated as 'normal', then this wouldn't be a problem” </i>Anon<i></i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Some listed a few reasons, from implications that women who buy condoms may be considered not serious in terms of sexual activity, to religious barriers:</b></h3></li></ul><p>“<i>Buying condoms can sometimes be deemed as <b>being easy, for women especially</b>. Sex is still <b>not talked about that openly</b>, so <b>people can find it embarrassing</b>. <b>Religion</b> is also a <b>barrier</b> to many happy purchases”</i> Una, Cardiff<b></b></p><h3><b>• Small number of participants thought the reason people were embarrassed to buy condoms was because they are having sex out of marriage, and feel like they are doing something wrong:</b></h3><p><i>“I feel the ones who use condoms mostly are people having sex out of marriage- illegitimate or too young. So the guilt they have in them because they are doing something wrong makes them feel embarrassed. Also, we live in a world where everyone constantly judges one another. Of course there are couples who want safe sex and they buy condoms. What can be done? Online selling of condoms perhaps?”</i></p><h2><b>Other proposed ways to make people less embarrassed to buy condoms</b></h2><ul><li><h3><b>Labs participants suggested a number of ways to solve the issue of embarrassment when purchasing condoms. Many mentioned having more vending machines would help solve the situation:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“More vending machines, with <b>complete</b> packs of <b>condoms</b> could be <b>beneficial</b>. That way women can <b>just go into toilets to buy them</b>, and this would <b>limit the people who see them</b>”</i><b> Una, Cardiff</b></p><p><i>“More <b>condom vending machines in toilets</b> - with <b>condoms at the same rates</b>, if not <b>lower</b> than the supermarkets/pharmacies” </i>Anon<i></i></p><ul><li><h3><b>Some participants believed that the problem could be solved by more public health adverts, emphasizing what an important part sex plays in our lives, as well as suggesting that having sex is something to be proud of, rather than uncomfortable:</b></h3></li></ul><p><i>“Maybe the problem can be <b>resolved by more advertising</b> (public health advertisements) to <b>emphasise how important safe sex is</b>. Also perhaps <b>try to emphasise that buying condoms should be a matter of pride </b>rather than shame since it suggests that you (the purchaser) are <b>desirable</b> and <b>attractive</b> (having a sexual partner)” </i>Anon<i></i></p><p><i>“We usually <b>hide the statement that we are going to have sex</b>. It's not a public declaration. So to show it in the shops and tell others is hugely embarrassing. <b>Advertising campaign, showing people buying condoms in shops</b>. Make it a <b>normal</b> thing to buy” </i>Andrew S, Leeds</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/LabsLine.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h2><i>What are your views on the subject?
