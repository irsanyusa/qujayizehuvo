He made an effort to sample something—even if only a mouthful—from all the places he visited.</p><p>The remaining food was devoured entirely by his crew and members of the public since waste isn't allowed.</p><p>Brain’s motivation for breaking this record was to showcase the variety of Nigerian cuisines. He said, “I would like to encourage people from around the world to come and explore the Nigerian food space.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cK7RopinZZ6srq%2BtjJ6YratdnrtufZRpZKudo6mutr7Ap6usZZmjeqJ5w5qwZqyfYq%2BzscCkZKCtmaO7pr%2FSZq6oqpyZerOxwqipnWeWZ8WmuNms</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reject-apc-or-face-hunger-protests-voters-warned-ahead-of-edo-poll.html><span>←</span><span>'Reject APC or face hunger protests' - Voters warned ahead of Edo poll</span></a>
