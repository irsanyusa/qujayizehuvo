Mabus declared senior naval leaders “shall direct comprehensive and regular inspections of all workplaces and common access spaces under their control” to find and eliminate the following:</p><a href=#><img decoding=async width=884 height=503 alt="barred items" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nation.time.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2013/06/barred-items.png sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>(Huh? No more “supremacist images, publications, or materials”? That’ll rule out an awful lot of what Navy public-affairs officers — driven to show that the sea service reigns supreme, especially compared to the others — spend their days doing.)</p><p><span>Some places are off-limits to commanders’ prying eyes. They “will not inspect assigned government laptop or desktop computers (with the exception of visible screensavers), assigned individual barracks rooms/living quarters, assigned desk drawers, assigned cabinet drawers, clothing (e.g., coats), assigned lockers, purses, brief cases, backpacks, private automobiles, and personal electronic devices (e.g., iPads, iPhones, etc.),” the message says. </span>Whew!</p><p>Mabus ordered his leaders to use <a href=#><strong>this</strong></a> “standardized reporting template” to account for transgressions. “All DON personnel shall be treated with dignity and respect,” he said. “Fostering a command climate free of all forms of unlawful discrimination, including sexual harassment, is essential to maintaining high morale, good order, discipline, and readiness.”</p><p>Not everyone associated with the message is hailing its arrival. “This type of action fails the SECNAV’s own direction by failing to treat us with dignity and respect,” one retired male naval officer says. “This is childish, foolish, and wasteful in a time of fiscal constraint, and just plain stupid.”</p><p>Sounds like he needs a spanking.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: “These inspections,” a Navy spokeswoman says, “are at DoD’s direction.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkam2sLqNraCmnV6YvK57kWlobGdga3xyfo6tn55lnpbDur%2BMpqCsq5mku27AzmaqnpmimLVurc2dZJ2do6m%2FsMWMrKSurF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./perigueux-optimise-son-foncier-24.html><span>←</span><span>Prigueux optimise son foncier (24)</span></a>
