When The Voice UK premiered last Sunday, one singer stood out from the crowd:&nbsp;Donel Mangena. The young artist wowed the coaches all of whom turned around for him. Sure, it was just the first episode and many other great singers are yet to grace the stage, but a lot of people are already betting that Donel will win the show."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The young artist wowed the coaches all of whom turned around for him. Sure, it was just the first episode and many other great singers are yet to grace the stage, but a lot of people are already betting that Donel will win the show.</h4><p>It’s easy to see why Donel was the favorite of the night. I mean, watch the video. His granny coming out and tearing up the stage helped. Things got so fired up that Jennifer Hudson said she was “willing to get into a fist fight” to see him win. He chose Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.Am as his coach, however. Fans soon took to social media to proclaim young Donel the winner. It’s way to early to tell. Taking the last season of the American Voice into account, a lot of the people we thought at first were going to win didn’t even make it to the top 8.</p><p>Still, there is a distinct possibility Donel will be in the finals IF he doesn’t peak too early. That’s a very real concern. He needs to strategize to win. I think his main gameplan should be to use his granny to be his backup dancer all the time.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/45D8BF6D00000578-5033717-image-m-101_1509434260184.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson Discusses What She Likes About ‘The Voice’ Over ‘American Idol’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Donel Mangena</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice uk</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qKjpWWUpLumuIymmKeflaOubsPIp2Svp5mYsm7Bymg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./0-9263-7601380606-00-html.html><span>←</span><span>THE PRESIDENCY: Attack at Arthurdale (National Affairs / THE PRESIDENCY)</span></a>
