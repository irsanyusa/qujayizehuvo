Some other northern Nigerian languages have variations to this word, but it still retains its original meaning. It is from the root word “du’a.” which means prayer in Arabic.</p><p><strong>2.’Alaafia’</strong></p><p>It translates to “peace” or “good health” in Yoruba. It was coined from the Arabic word “Al-afiyah.” which also means “good health”.</p><p><strong>3.’Alubosa’</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Alubosa” translates to “onion” in Yoruba. Which was originally coined from the Arabic word “Al-basal”. This must have prompted the Hausas to adopt its usage as they call onion “albasa.”</p><p><strong>4. ‘Asiri’</strong></p><p>This translates to “secret” in Yoruba. It is a word borrowed from the Hausa language; with a similar meaning. This Hausa word must have been coined from the Arabic word “as-sirr,” also meaning secret.</p><p><strong>5. ‘Barika’</strong></p><p>This word in the Yoruba language is a form of congratulatory greeting. In the Hausa language, it is spelt “barka”. The root word is coined from “al- baraka” which means greetings in Arabic.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>6. ‘Suuru’</strong></p><p>This is a word with the same meaning as in the Yoruba and Hausa language. It means “patience”.</p><p><strong>7. ‘Wahala’</strong></p><p>This word is a common word which has been incorporated into the average Nigerian’s vocabulary and even the West African Pidgin English vocabulary . In the Yoruba and Hausa language, it translates to “trouble”. It is coined from the Arabic word “wahla,” which means “fear” or “terror.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cIOMsKarnKNirq%2BwjKmfq5mjmsButc1mq6GdXa68s8HBmmSlmZ6cwqKzxGauoqyYYrWiwdKaZKiqXZa%2Foq7InGSoqpmctq97k6NvsWimrw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victorias-secret-model-and-partner-with-down-syndrome-prove-love-knows-no-boundaries-812475.html><span>←</span><span>Victorias Secret Model and Partner With Down Syndrome Prove Love Knows No Boundaries</span></a>
