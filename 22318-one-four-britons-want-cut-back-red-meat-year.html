<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>One in four Britons want to cut back on red meat this year</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>Brits are twice as likely to cite health benefits as a reason for cutting back than helping the environment</h3><p>New data shows that one in four Britons (24%) plan on eating less red meat in the New Year, with women, over 55s and higher social classes most likely to make it a resolution.</p><p>A quarter (27%) of women intend to cut back, versus 20% of men. Some 28% of those falling into the ABC1 social categories do, versus just 18% of C2DE. And while 24% of people of all ages hope to reduce their meat intake, this increases to 28% among those over 55 years old.</p><p>So, why the lifestyle change? In line with the fact that half of us also plan on eating more fresh fruit and veg (51% and 47% respectively), the most popular reason for reducing red meat intake is to improve our health.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Red_meat_1-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>But that’s not the only reason. One in eight (13%) simply don’t like meat very much, 7% want to save money and just over a quarter (27%) want to help the environment.</p><h4><strong>A meat-free diet isn’t the best way to save the planet, say Brits</strong></h4><p>Past YouGov data shows the <a href=#>proportion of Britons who believe we should eat less meat to help the environment is increasing</a>, from 28% in 2015, to 34% in 2018. Among 18 to 24 year olds it now rises to 50%.</p><p><a href=#>A widely circulated study</a> released last year in the Science Journal looked at the environmental impact of 40,000 farms in 119 countries which produce 90% of all food consumed in the world. It posited that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your carbon footprint.</p><p>However, YouGov data reveals that only 18% believe that changing to a plant-only diet is the action with the ‘greatest positive impact’ on the environment. This is some way behind recycling (48%), changing to a hybrid car (9%) or using low-energy light bulbs (5%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Red_meat_2-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Britons more likely to want government intervention on health than environment</strong></h4><p>Further, although more and more Britons feel we should eat less red meat for environmental reasons, the public is split three ways on whether they the government should get involved.</p><p>One third (35%) support government involvement in getting people to eat less meat, 29% neither support nor oppose, and a third (33%) oppose.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Meat_corrected-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>By contrast, people are considerably more supportive of government intervention to change behaviour around people’s health. For example, two thirds (67%) support the government making diet recommendations to reduce obesity, with just one in eight (13%) opposing the idea, 68% support government intervention to get people to do more exercise and 77% support it to encourage giving up smoking.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p>See the full results <a href=#>here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmeAcoSMqKWeZZakwrN5waugraeeqHq4rc2tZJytpGKvoq%2FKZqmenF2isqLAjLKcmqo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maureen-oconnor-former-san-diego-mayor-bet-more-than-1-billion-as-a-result-of-gambling-addiction.html><span>←</span><span>Maureen OConnor: Former San Diego Mayor Bet More Than $1 Billion as a Result of Gambling Addictio</span></a>
