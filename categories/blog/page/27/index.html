Our brothers and sisters are often the only people in our lives from beginning to end, and their influence is just as broad as that timeline.
That was the conclusion reached by TIME’s Jeffrey Kluger in a 2006 cover story about the effects of sibling-hood. And, as many U.S. states mark Siblings Day on April 10, there’s no better time to look at that research as another reason to be thankful for those closest of relatives.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Wissembourg accueille une station d'puration transfrontalire franco-allemande</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>

From weird landscapes to&nbsp;food items that totally look like something else, here are 15+&nbsp;photos that were curated by&nbsp;Bright Side which will make you want to&nbsp;look twice to&nbsp;figure out what’s really going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;the picture!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>BATTLE OF THE BINGE | TIME</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

Benjamin Wynne, 20, underwent two of the most time-honored rites of passage at Louisiana State University last week. He received a pledge pin from the fraternity that voted him into the brotherhood, and he got rip-roaring drunk to celebrate. Wynne and his fellow Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers began their bacchanalia with an off-campus keg party featuring “funneling,” in which beer is shot through a rubber hose into the drinker’s mouth. Next came a communal bender at Murphy’s bar, a frat hangout a few hundred yards from L.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Actually Stay Hydrated</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

The teenage lifeguards under her charge wouldn’t always remember to drink water, so she remembers constantly nudging them to guzzle more H2O. The reminders worked. “I don’t recall any of my staff becoming dehydrated,” says Haar, who is now chair of the department of interdisciplinary health sciences at New York Institute of Technology.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Inter Miami CF: 2024 TIME100 Most Influential Companies</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

When Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas landed, along with his Major League Soccer (MLS) team, in Hong Kong in February for a preseason exhibition, the sea of pink Inter Miami shirts he spotted confirmed what’s become clear: the team, which played its debut season just four years ago but last July signed Lionel Messi to a stunning deal that reordered the soccer universe, is now a globally relevant enterprise.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>MLB Opening Day 2015: Map Gives You An Idea of Support Before Season</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

Guessing what baseball team a state supports may be easy in some cases—Massachusetts supports the Red Sox, and Georgia likes the Braves, for instance—but what about all the states without a team?
A new map released by Facebook will give you an idea, just in time for Major League Baseball’s opening day on April 5. The map breaks down the amount of Facebook likes each baseball team had from users located in particular counties in the United States.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Public says no to prison votes</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

Many Brits say no prison votes, deport Abu Qatada regardless and bring back power from the European Court
According to last week’s poll from YouGov, a majority of Brits think Abu Qatada should be deported from the UK ‘regardless’ of whether or not a fair trial abroad can be guaranteed. In contrast, just 22% said he should be deported ‘only if’ a fair trial can be guaranteed.
The results belong to an on-going collaboration between YouGov and Dr June Edmunds of Cambridge and Sussex Universities, focussing on the politics of human rights in Britain and Europe.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sabrina Carpenters boyfriend timeline: who has she dated?</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

As part of Variety’s “Behind the Song,” “Shōgun” composer Leopold Ross broke down the show’s dramatic main title theme.
What started as a simple email from a friend he’d worked with together in the past, asking Ross if he wanted help work on the score for “Shōgun,” turned into a nearly two-year-long collaboration with composer Nick Chuba, brother and composer Atticus Ross and arranger/composer Taro Ishida.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/26/>← Prev Page</a>
