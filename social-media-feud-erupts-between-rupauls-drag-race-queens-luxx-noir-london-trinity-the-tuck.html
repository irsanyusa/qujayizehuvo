She did not mention Luxx, who is a front-runner in the competition. After some fans pointed out that Trinity had not mentioned Luxx, Trinity responded by saying that she simply had her favorites and that she loved all three queens equally.</p><p>Luxx took to Twitter to express her feelings about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">situation</a>. She tweeted that she would be “rotted” too if she spent as much money as Trinity to look like her. Luxx also accused Trinity of throwing shade at her and supporting negative comments about her on social media. She then brought up allegations that Trinity was behind a shady Reddit account.</p><p>Trinity responded to Luxx’s tweet by quoting it and saying that she had not said anything about Luxx. Trinity then stated that she did not like Luxx and that Luxx had a “nasty attitude.” Luxx clapped back, asking Trinity to stop throwing “sideways shots” at her.</p><p>Fans have been divided over the feud, with some supporting Luxx and others supporting Trinity. Some fans pointed out that Luxx has been critical of other queens on the show, and has invalidated their drag. Others have criticized Trinity for not being more supportive of Luxx, who is a fellow drag queen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@TrinityTheTuck</a> you only say “I did great” after people call you out for blatantly leaving me out or saying something shady towards me.
