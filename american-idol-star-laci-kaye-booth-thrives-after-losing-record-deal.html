Announcing that she’ll be navigating her career independently, she also asserted that women must have creative control in the music industry.</p><p>“I got dropped from my label,” she said. “The first label that I signed with, the first label I met three years ago when I came to Nashville.”</p><p>A month after this heartbreaking yet liberating news, the American Idol star is tirelessly exerting efforts in making her name known. She recently posted on Instagram, compiling all her tour-related activities in the remaining dates of 2022.</p><p>“Looks like I’m gonna be living out of a suitcase through the end of the year!!!!” she wrote.</p><p>Booth will open for Blanco Brown’s 16-city music tour until December 3 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In addition, the country singer will also be with Noah Thompson and <a href=#>HunterGirl</a> for their tour. Booth will be alternating with fellow American Idol alum Grace Leer as opening acts.

Thank you for being so brave and vulnerable you are incredible. This was such a magic day,” fellow composer Sophia Scott commented.</p><p>While “Overnight” can clearly pass as a hit, Booth hasn’t disclosed any details yet regarding its full version.
