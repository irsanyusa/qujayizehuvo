She had her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tattoos on full display</a> as she stood with her backside facing the camera in the highest pair of heels ever. The heels are encrusted with sparkly stones that match the itty bitty silver fringe outfit perfectly. &nbsp;The post currently has over 2.7 million likes on Instagram.</p><p>One thing that is very noticeable from the promotional image is that Cardi has a tattoo for her husband’s name. If you look closely at her left thigh, you can see “Offset” written in dainty letters. The infamous back tattoo that goes all the way down her side is also facing the camera.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>CARDI B SHARES WHAT SHE DID BEFORE HER SURGERIES TO CREATE FAKE CURVES</a></strong></p><p>Cardi had another treat for her fans. This time the rapper posed in a pink sparkly outfit that was made up of just stickers. The gems were quite literally just stuck onto her body with some gorgeous pieces of fringe hanging off of her legs and arms. She posted a video that definitely got hearts racing.</p><p>This was part of another look to promote “Up” and led to a gorgeous photo of Cardi in a see-through chair. The chair is suspended over a pool as she flaunts her sexy body only covered by the gem stickers.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cardi-is-famous-for-her-unique-style>Cardi Is Famous For Her Unique Style</h3><p>At the 2020 FN Achievement Awards, Cardi was named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Style Influencer of the Year.</a> In 2018, she partnered with Reebok for some very popular shoe collections. And, expect to see some more merch of her own in the future. She filed paperwork to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trademark the phrase “WAP”</a> which she plans to include in a line of clothing and household items.</p><p>Cardi is never afraid to push boundaries or take risks with her bold looks. To promote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>the single “WAP,”</a> she posed topless with Megan as the song broke numerous records. The duo were literally glowing as they showed off their backsides and wore sky-high silver heels.</p><p>And, on the first day of 2021, Cardi was already flaunting her bikini body to her 82 million followers. She posed in a pink sequined two-piece with hoop earrings and silver jewelry. This post received over 5.3 million likes for the mother of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>2-year-old daughter Kulture</a> that she shares with Offset.</p><p>One of Cardi’s most recent looks that generated a lot of buzz on social media is this red see-through figure hugging dress. It is outlined with white piping details and Cardi showed off that she was only wearing a thong underneath in an Instagram video.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>CARDI B POSTS NUDE STRIPPER TWERKING VIDEO AT WILD BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH OFFSET [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>The message here is that Cardi can literally rock anything that she wears.
