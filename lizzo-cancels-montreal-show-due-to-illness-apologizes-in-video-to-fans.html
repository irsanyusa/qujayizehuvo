The singer explained her symptoms, saying she thought she might have the flu. She apologized to fans and promised to honor their tickets.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lizzo-cancels-montreal-show-due-to-illness>Lizzo Cancels Montreal Show Due to Illness</h2><p>In her Instagram video, Lizzo is wrapped in blankets and wearing a face mask. She tells fans, “I had a sore throat last night, and a headache, and I went to bed. And I woke up this morning and it was worse, and my body is weak, and I have chills, and my head hurts.”</p><p>The singer added that if it was a cold, she would usually feel better after showering, eating, and taking meds. However, she added that her current illness was “getting worse,” speculating that she might have the flu.</p><p>“I have to make the unfortunate decision to cancel today,” Lizzo continued. “I want to find a date to reschedule, but I just can’t perform tonight. This is the second time I’ve ever had to cancel due to health in my entire career. And I will make it up to you, Montreal. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, Lizzo’s next scheduled concert is in Hartford, Connecticut, on Saturday. It’s not clear yet if that concert will also have to be canceled.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LIZZO BRINGS DRAG QUEENS ON STAGE DURING TENNESSEE CONCERT</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-announcement-received-a-mixed-response>The Announcement Received a Mixed Response</h2><p>Lizzo’s concert cancellation received a mixed response from fans on Instagram. While some people told the singer to get well soon, others complained about having traveled to see her. One user wondered why Lizzo didn’t announce the cancellation earlier.</p><p>Meanwhile, another fan commented that they were seeing Lizzo’s post while on the bus heading to the concert. Someone else wrote that they had spent money to travel from Newfoundland to see the show.</p><p>Lizzo isn’t the only artist to receive criticism for canceling a show recently. Last month, country star Morgan Wallen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a concert</a> in Mississippi due to losing his voice. Fans were already sitting in the venue when the announcement was made.</p><p>Wallen’s decision to cancel has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">led to a lawsuit</a> from an angry fan and even sparked rumors that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was too intoxicated</a> to perform. His record label has denied this allegation.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_LukeBryan_Stagecoach_Scott-DudelsonGetty-Images-for-Stagecoach-220x147.jpeg alt="Luke Bryan Releases New Song ‘But I Got a Beer in My Hand’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y6Kxs6ddmK6vr8Slqmaln6PBs7HApWSsoJ%2BseqXBxGarqGWZobmvsdKsZJqon6G8qLXZnqpmoZ5iw6qwxKhkraddm66vv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ive-done-my-job-as-trader-do-yours-as-professor-obi-replies-soludo.html><span>←</span><span>I've done my job as trader, do yours as professor - Obi repliesSoludo</span></a>
