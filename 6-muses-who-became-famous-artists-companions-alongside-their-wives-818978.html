Fanny Cornforth
Cornforth met Dante Gabriel Rossetti in&nbsp;1856. She became his model and lover. They kept their relationship a&nbsp;secret from the artist’s wife, Elizabeth Siddal. Many biographers speculated that Siddal disliked Cornforth, but there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;evidence that the woman was even aware of&nbsp;her existence."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She became his model and lover. They kept their relationship a&nbsp;secret from the artist’s wife, Elizabeth Siddal. Many biographers speculated that Siddal disliked Cornforth, but there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;evidence that the woman was even aware of&nbsp;her existence.</p><p>After Siddal’s death in&nbsp;1862, Cornforth moved into Rossetti’s house as&nbsp;his housekeeper. The woman belonged to&nbsp;the rural working class and had a&nbsp;coarse accent with no&nbsp;education. All of&nbsp;this shocked Rossetti’s family. His brother praised the girl’s beauty but pointed out her low intellect. Some of&nbsp;the artist’s friends never accepted Cornforth and pressured him to&nbsp;end the affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b7/5d5/f810ea5c3990f637bd82133c54.jpg><p>During her relationship with Rossetti, Cornforth gained weight. This became the reason for their inside jokes. He&nbsp;affectionately referred to&nbsp;her as&nbsp;“my&nbsp;dear elephant,” and she called him “Rhino.” When they were apart, the artist drew cartoons of&nbsp;elephants and sent them to&nbsp;her, often signing them “Old Rhinoceros.”</p><p>After Rossetti’s health seriously deteriorated, his family forced Cornforth to&nbsp;leave the house. The artist paid for her accommodations nearby, saying, “You are the only person whom it&nbsp;is&nbsp;my&nbsp;duty to&nbsp;provide for, and you may be&nbsp;sure&nbsp;I should do&nbsp;my&nbsp;utmost as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;breath in&nbsp;my&nbsp;body or&nbsp;a&nbsp;penny in&nbsp;my&nbsp;purse.” Rossetti also gave her several of&nbsp;his paintings, making sure her legal ownership was documented.</p><p><h2>Camille Claudel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e7/fe3/8edb9f573b9b3f9ea25b559f24.jpg><p>Claudel began <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>working</a> in&nbsp;the studio of&nbsp;Auguste Rodin<strong> </strong>in&nbsp;1883. She was his model and lover. But the couple didn’t live together, as&nbsp;the sculptor didn’t want to&nbsp;end his 20-year relationship with Rose Beuret.</p><p>Claudel’s family, especially her mother, was very unhappy about this affair, and she never approved of&nbsp;the fact that her daughter decided to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;artist. Because of&nbsp;this, Claudel was forced to&nbsp;leave the family home.</p><p>In&nbsp;1892, after the termination of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pregnancy, Claudel ceased to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Rodin’s mistress. Even&nbsp;so, they would continue to&nbsp;meet regularly until 1898.</p><p><h2>Marie-Thérèse Walter</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02e/86d/7516675a3bb0f31342f069fb7e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1927, a&nbsp;man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>approached</a> Walter in&nbsp;the street and said, “You have an&nbsp;interesting face. I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;portrait of&nbsp;you. I&nbsp;am Picasso.” From then&nbsp;on, Walter began to&nbsp;pose for him, and they began a&nbsp;relationship. At&nbsp;that time, the artist was married to&nbsp;Olga Khokhlova, and they had a&nbsp;5-year-old son.</p><p>In&nbsp;1934, Walter got pregnant. When a&nbsp;friend informed Khokhlova that her husband had a&nbsp;longtime relationship with a&nbsp;woman who was expecting a&nbsp;child from him, she immediately left Picasso with their son, Paulo. In&nbsp;September 1935, Walter gave birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;daughter, Maya.</p><p>By&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;Maya’s birth, Picasso had already been seeing several other women. The relationship between Walter and the artist ended in&nbsp;1940. However, they continued to&nbsp;meet from time to&nbsp;time. In&nbsp;1955, when Khokhlova died, Picasso called Walter and asked her to&nbsp;marry him. She refused. Picasso never saw her again.</p><p><h2>Lydia Delectorskaya</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d04/b35/07709e572f888b4fa45cf2caae.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1932, Deleсtorskaya <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took</a> a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;maid and secretary in&nbsp;the house of&nbsp;Henri Matisse. It&nbsp;was 3&nbsp;years before the artist asked her to&nbsp;pose for him. At&nbsp;this time, Deleсtorskaya was&nbsp;25, and Matisse was 65.</p><p>Their cooperation was coherent and successful. The young woman ran the artist’s studio, selected models, and dealt with dealers, sellers, and galleries. Everything ran like clockwork.</p><p>Their close working partnership resulted in&nbsp;Matisse’s wife of&nbsp;40&nbsp;years drawing an&nbsp;ultimatum, stating, “It’s her or&nbsp;me!” The artist chose his wife, but she left him anyway in&nbsp;1939. That’s when he&nbsp;asked Deleсtorskaya to&nbsp;come back to&nbsp;help him with the studio. They stayed together for the rest of&nbsp;his life.</p><p><h2>Dorothy Norman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d6/58c/dd48ad59a49a52b9742c95b952.jpg><p>Dorothy Norman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> Alfred Stieglitz in&nbsp;1927. At&nbsp;the time, he&nbsp;was already a&nbsp;successful photographer and was well respected.</p><p>Norman and Stieglitz were both married&nbsp;— she was married to&nbsp;Edward A. Norman, the son of&nbsp;an&nbsp;entrepreneur, and Stieglitz was married to&nbsp;artist Georgia O’Keeffe. Despite this, they began a&nbsp;long-term romance. It&nbsp;started when Norman became Stieglitz’s student.</p><p>Their relationship lasted until his death in&nbsp;1946. Dorothy Norman’s marriage to&nbsp;Edward A. Norman ended in&nbsp;divorce in&nbsp;1951.</p><p><h2>Helga Testorf</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/711/788/f6b9205074a013f238a8a0e87e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1986, Andrew Wyeth <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that for the past 15&nbsp;years, he&nbsp;had made 240 drawings and paintings of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman named Helga Testorf. The paintings were extraordinary yet subtle. He&nbsp;had not previously told anyone about his work with this model, not even his wife.</p><p>Testorf was, for a&nbsp;time, the nurse of&nbsp;a&nbsp;farmer who lived near the Wyeths’ home. Neither the artist nor his muse made their relationship public. His wife, Betsy Wyeth, later spoke about the paintings in&nbsp;several interviews, saying that Testorf’s images served as&nbsp;the basis and inspiration for Wyeth’s other works.</p><p>When asked about a&nbsp;possible affair between her husband and his muse, Betsy Wyeth ironically remarked that she had doubts about it&nbsp;because if&nbsp;they crossed over into that territory, Wyeth would have lost the magic in&nbsp;the paintings.</p><p>And here’s the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kitchen maid who became Christian Dior’s <a href=#>muse</a>.
