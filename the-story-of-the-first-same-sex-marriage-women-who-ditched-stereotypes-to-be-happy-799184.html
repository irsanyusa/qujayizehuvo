As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, it&nbsp;wasn’t just their passion for teaching that brought them together. In&nbsp;each other, they found a&nbsp;love that, at&nbsp;that time, was taboo.</p><p>Marcela and Elisa <a href=#>started off</a> as&nbsp;close friends, but as&nbsp;time went&nbsp;on, their <strong>relationship became even more intimate</strong>. Their connection was so&nbsp;strong that even those around them noticed&nbsp;it. When Marcela’s parents got wind of&nbsp;the possibility that their daughter could be&nbsp;sparking a&nbsp;scandal by&nbsp;being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;same-sex relationship, they decided it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;<strong>take her out</strong> of&nbsp;that school.</p><p>Marcela’s parents shipped her off to&nbsp;Madrid in&nbsp;hopes that distance would quell whatever passion she and Elisa shared. But, they were wrong.</p><p><h2>Adopting a&nbsp;fake identity was the only way they could be&nbsp;officially married.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3da/381/9b19c15bdab0500b81ec4949f4.jpg><p>When Elisa and Marcela met again, years later, they were already well into their teaching careers. After completing her studies, Elisa became a&nbsp;teacher at&nbsp;Coristanco, while Marcela was teaching in&nbsp;the village of&nbsp;Calo.</p><p>After reuniting, the 2&nbsp;ladies picked up&nbsp;their relationship from where they left off. Even though their jobs meant that they were in&nbsp;different towns during the day, they spent their nights together. This went on&nbsp;until 1901 when Elisa adopted a&nbsp;false identity so&nbsp;she could marry her beloved. Not only did she adopt a&nbsp;masculine appearance, but she also renamed herself Mario.</p><p>On&nbsp;June&nbsp;8, 1901, Marcela became <a href=#>officially married</a> to&nbsp;Elisa, who was under the guise of&nbsp;Mario at&nbsp;the time. This event would later be&nbsp;known as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the earliest recorded same-sex marriages.</p><p><h2>When their secret came out, they were forced to&nbsp;flee.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/48b/d56/f0790e5b52b9a51e8782f0f536.jpg><p>As&nbsp;one might expect, Elisa and Marcela’s marriage did not go&nbsp;unnoticed by&nbsp;their neighbors. The “<strong>marriage without a&nbsp;man”</strong> (as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was dubbed) sparked several reactions and even made it&nbsp;into newspaper headlines. Soon, those around them could no&nbsp;longer turn a&nbsp;blind eye.</p><p>A&nbsp;doctor <a href=#>was ordered</a> to&nbsp;confirm if&nbsp;Mario was indeed a&nbsp;man. Even though Mario tried to&nbsp;claim to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hermaphrodite, the true nature of&nbsp;the marriage was eventually revealed. Sadly, this meant some <strong>difficult consequences</strong> for the spouses. The couple lost their jobs and were excommunicated. An&nbsp;arrest warrant was served as&nbsp;well.</p><p>It&nbsp;was believed that Elisa and Marcela left their home and eventually ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;Argentina.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;2008 book by&nbsp;Narciso de&nbsp;Gabriel narrated a&nbsp;possible ending to&nbsp;their love story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/074/d20/19619f57ffb126afa4c72982e2.jpg><p>Not much is&nbsp;known about the lives of&nbsp;Elisa and Marcela after they fled from their home. However, in&nbsp;2008, historian Narciso de&nbsp;Gabriel released a&nbsp;book titled, <a href=#>Elisa e&nbsp;Marcela&nbsp;— Alén dos homes</a>, in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;attempted to&nbsp;fill in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the gaps.</p><p>In&nbsp;the book, Gabriel <a href=#>narrated</a> how Elisa and Marcela were caught, imprisoned, and later released in&nbsp;Porto, Portugal. The author also claimed that Elisa, who adopted the name Maria, <strong>married Christian Jensen</strong> in&nbsp;1903.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;film about the ladies led to&nbsp;the discovery of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long lost descendant.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e0a/19f/5fa5b05f95830b97c1c7965159.jpg><p>Several decades after Elisa and Marcela fought for their love, a&nbsp;film was made in&nbsp;their honor. Released in&nbsp;<a href=#>2019</a>, Elisa &&nbsp;Marcela retold the story of&nbsp;these pioneering women. Interestingly, it&nbsp;also resulted in&nbsp;the discovery of&nbsp;Marcela’s descendant, Norma Graciela Moure.</p><p>Norma, who only had <strong>a&nbsp;name and an&nbsp;old photograph</strong> of&nbsp;her ancestor to&nbsp;hold on&nbsp;to, became interested in&nbsp;her lineage as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the buzz about the film. She did an&nbsp;online search and realized that the photo she had was of&nbsp;Marcela, who happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;her great-grandmother.</p><p>If&nbsp;you were stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where society wouldn’t let you marry the person you loved, what would you do&nbsp;to&nbsp;achieve happiness?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq6iqqWK8p3nToZxmnpmnwLV50pqknmWjmsVuucCrqaKZl5p6uLvMnqVmr5ikeqW105yfnpxdqMGmvsSoq7Kolah6tbuMm5xmoJGlvbp5lnJwanBkZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-secret-lives-of-mormon-wives-swinging-sex-scandal-hulu-1236088947.html><span>←</span><span>The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives Chronicles Swinging Sex Scandal in New Hulu Series</span></a>
