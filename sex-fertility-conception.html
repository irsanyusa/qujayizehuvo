Around half of the women were sexually active and half were not. One study looked at helper T cells and the other looked at antibodies. Helper T-cells direct the immune system to the right targets and play a role in determining the best type of response. Antibodies flag pathogens as invaders and can disarm some of them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In one study the researchers found that sexually active women had greater changes in their helper T cells. (Type 1 helper T cells help the body defend itself from invaders and type 2 helper T cells help the body learn that the presence of what otherwise would be viewed as an invader, like sperm for example, are actually OK.) The women who were sexually active had higher levels of the type 2 cells during the period of their menstrual cycle where the uterine lining gets thicker as it prepares for pregnancy, and they had higher levels of type 1 cells during a phase in their cycle when the ovaries’ follicles mature. The researchers did not see these changes in the women who were abstinent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the other study, the researchers looked at antibodies. During the same two phases of the menstrual cycles, they found different fluctuations in two types of antibodies in the women who didn’t have sex and the women who did. The researchers say this also could mean the sexually active women’s bodies were preparing in a unique way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Having sex seems to be a signal to the woman’s immune system to focus on the kinds of immune response that promote conception, rather than other kinds of immune response,” says Lorenz. “Essentially, it changes the immune system’s priority from defending against disease and repairing tissues, to helping along conception and implantation, and preparing for a possible pregnancy.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prior research has shown that women who are sexually active have different immunity patterns than women who are not, Lorenz says. “But no one has put those two ideas together: that sexual activity may be the necessary cue to engage these shifts,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The researchers were not looking at women who were trying to conceive, so the authors say the impact on women’s fertility still remains unclear.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The study is provocative and interesting,” says Dr. James Segars, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “The problem is that both of the studies have a very small sample size. I would have liked to see more on the stress levels of the abstinent women, how oxytocin—which is released during orgasm—plays a role.” Segars was not involved in either study.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“From a scientific standpoint, I can’t tell my patients to do this based on these studies. But we need more information on this. I think if a couple is having sex, they are likely in a better situation to have kids. They probably ovulate more often and have a better immune system overall,” says Segars.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lorenz agrees that the research needs further study. “We need to do a lot more research about how sexual activity impacts the immune system, and whether or not these effects generalize to women who are on hormonal medications, or have health conditions, or have irregular menstrual cycles,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Much like pregnant women, women who are trying to conceive get advice on very intimate things from a wide variety of sources, from their doctors to their grocery baggers,” she adds. “So ultimately, my advice is: do what works right in your relationship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtaGZqgXKEjqycsWWWmr%2B1tcuiq7Jlk6S7pLHPraCopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paramount-global-kkr-near-deal-for-simon-schuster-1235689601.html><span>←</span><span>Paramount Global, KKR Sign $1.6 Billion Deal for Simon &amp;amp; Schuster</span></a>
