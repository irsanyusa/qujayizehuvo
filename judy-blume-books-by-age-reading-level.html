Blume, considered by many to be <a href=# rel=noopener>the patron saint of YA narratives</a>, has written more than 25 books for young readers since she made her debut with <i>The One in the Middle Is the Green Kangaroo</i> in 1969. Over the course of her career, Blume’s trailblazing books have set new standards for what literature for kids and teens can look like. Her work has become beloved for its forthright honesty—and garnered plenty of controversy for its refusal to gloss over topics like sex and periods. A long-awaited film adaptation of <a href=# rel=noopener>her most famous novel, </a><i>Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret.</i>—which follows an 11-year-old girl as she navigates a move, a new school, and her changing sense of self—will premiere on April 28.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Blume may be best known for her books for and about girls on the brink of puberty, but <a href=# rel=noopener>she has long written for a diverse readership</a>, giving people of all ages a chance to see themselves in her stories. For the youngest of readers, Blume has published picture books like <i>The Pain and the Great One</i>, which addresses the tensions of sibling rivalry with humor and heart. Her grade-school novels like <i>Blubber</i> and <i>Iggie</i>’s <i>House</i> give readers the chance to explore tough topics like bullying and racism. In her YA books, from <i>Deenie</i> to <i>Tiger Eyes</i>, Blume writes frankly about menstruation and masturbation while also tackling big experiences like the loss of a parent. And, in her handful of books for adults, Blume takes a straight look at the complexities of life and love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From picture books to adult novels, here are the best Judy Blume books to read at every age.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ages 5-8</h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><i>The Pain and the Great One</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/paint-and-the-great-one.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In this playful picture book, Blume tackles the all-too-relatable issue of <a href=#>sibling rivalry</a> with warmth and humor. Centering on the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of the “Great One,” a strong-willed 8-year-old sister and the “Pain,” her pesky 6-year-old little brother, the book is a clever story about the trying (and sometimes tender) relationship between siblings who are determined to find out which kid is more beloved by their parents.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: The Pain and the Great One on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>10 Questions with Judy Blume</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ages 6-8</h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><i>Freckle Juice</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Andrew, a second grader, there’s nothing more attractive than the prospect of having freckles, a seeming solution to never having to wash his face. Andrew’s desire for freckles is so great that he pays his sly classmate for a recipe for “freckle juice,” a nasty concoction of fruit juice and condiments. The potion does not give him freckles, but it does teach him an important lesson about being happy in the skin you’re in—a message that’s as valuable for adults as it is for kids.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Freckle Juice on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ages 8-9</h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><i>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/22.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Blume returns to the ever-relevant topic of sibling rivalry with the Hatcher brothers—9-year-old Peter and his precocious 3-year-old brother, Farley, who’s affectionately nicknamed “Fudge.” Fudge’s irrepressible antics are by turns endearing and infuriating to good-hearted Peter, who feels that his brother’s outrageous mischief makes him, by comparison, a “fourth grade nothing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Are You There God?

While Jill isn’t the instigator of Linda’s abuse, she becomes a willing participant, preferring to pile on the cruelty rather than to defy Wendy. But soon the tables turn.

In suburbia, aided and abetted by her new friends, including the precocious Nancy, Margaret is consumed by uncertainties. She’s ambivalent about religion and anxious about getting her first period, her first bra, and her first crush. In writing Margaret, Blume created an infinitely relatable heroine for any girl on the brink of puberty, validating the confusion, hopes, and fears of generations of pre-teens.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Are You There God?

For 13-year-old Deenie, the future is far from a priority, even though her overbearing mother is hyperfocused on ensuring that she becomes a model. Deenie’s far more interested in being a normal seventh grader and making the cheerleading squad. All of that changes, however, when she’s diagnosed with <a href=#>scoliosis</a> and instructed to wear a body brace for the next four years. As Deenie adjusts to her new normal, she becomes increasingly aware of the world around her and how she might move through it as an adult.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Deenie on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><i>Tiger Eyes</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/15.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Blume addresses grief with a tender and nuanced touch in <i>Tiger Eyes</i>, a novel that centers on 15-year-old Davey as she reels from the shocking <a href=#>death of her father</a>.
