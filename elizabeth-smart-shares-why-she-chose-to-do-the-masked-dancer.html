She was all about fun, and living, and living life to the fullest, and passion, and I just thought, ‘She would love this. I’m going to do this. Why not?’”</p><p>Elizabeth said the experience was “so fun,” adding, “The saddest part of it was saying goodbye to everyone.” She admitted she was initially disappointed to be voted off, but said, “Then I watched the other episodes and I was like ‘Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.’”</p><p>Only one of the judges correctly guessed that Elizabeth was under the mask. Other guesses included Megyn Kelly, Kathy Griffin, and Karlie Kloss. But Brian Austin Green predicted it would be Elizabeth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CH5bbshsrEp/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-elizabeth-doing-now>What Is Elizabeth Doing Now?</h3><p>Last year, a series premiered on Lifetime called Elizabeth Smart: Finding Justice.

Are you worried? Was it hard for you to come back here?’” Elizabeth told Extra. “I finally said, ‘No, I feel triumphant… Nothing bad, nothing like what happened to me can ever happen here again. It’s no longer a secret.’ I hope that’s how each of these survivors walk away feeling.”</p><p>Elizabeth also works with the <a href=#>Elizabeth Smart Foundation</a>, and has published two books — My Story in 2013, and Where There’s Hope: Healing, Moving Forward, and Never Giving Up in 2018.</p><p>She’s also a mother.
