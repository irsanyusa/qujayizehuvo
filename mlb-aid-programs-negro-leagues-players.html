On Wednesday, The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) announced an expansion of financial assistance opportunities to support players of the Negro Leagues.&nbsp;
The initiative will create an annual benefit to financially aid Negro League players who played for less than four seasons. While there were other Black-only leagues players participated in, the Negro National League was a professional baseball league established in 1920 as racism and Jim Crow laws barred Black players from joining professional teams with white players."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This is another example of players using their collective voice to bring about progress.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The program to provide financial assistance to former Negro League players will serve as an addition to the already existing MLB Players Pension Plan and the non-vested benefits program for retired players.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">About 60 players from the Negro Leagues will attend a game between the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals on June 20 at Rickwood Field, which was home to the Negro Leagues’ Birmingham Black Barons from 1924 through 1960.
