A YouGov poll from February shows that a broad majority of the British public support the tax.</p><p>Recent YouGov research shows that two thirds (65%) of British adults support the mansion tax, while just 22% oppose the policy and 17% don’t know.</p><p>Conservative voters are the only group to have less than a majority in support of the tax, though supporters still outnumber detractors 49%-41%. During 2012, however, Conservative voters consistently <a href=#>supported the policy by a majority</a>, with support ranging from 57% in January to 68% in February and 59% in October.</p><p>Some Lib Dems have argued that the use of an average figure of the cost per home owner is misleading, as properties close to the £2 million mark would pay little extra. It also has been suggested that the issue could be a “red line” for the Lib Dems in possible coalition talks with Conservatives in 2015.</p><p><strong><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></strong></p><p class=title><a href=#>Join YouGov today!
