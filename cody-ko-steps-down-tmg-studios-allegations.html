The six shows under the network will put out new episodes “in the coming weeks” after a brief, seemingly unplanned hiatus.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ko has not commented on the allegations, raised in May by Mongeau during a live recording of her podcast Cancelled. In the show, Mongeau said she slept with Ko when she was 17. Her <a href=#>comment came to wider attention</a> in July, when commentary YouTuber D’Angelo Wallace released a video discussing the situation and asking his viewers to take it seriously. Following Wallace’s video, Ko, who had<strong> </strong>over 9 million subscribers across five Youtube channels, has lost followers in droves. According to <a href=#>SocialBlade</a>, he’s lost over 270,000 subscribers in the past month.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Representatives for Ko did not return a request for comment. Mongeau previously declined to comment on the story.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As pressure has mounted for Ko to acknowledge Mongeau’s allegation, creators in his orbit are also facing demands to speak out. His wife, Kelsey Kreppel, was inundated with hate comments in her YouTube videos and one of his recent collaborators, Brittany Broski, put out a<strong> </strong>statement on her Instagram stories. Drew Phillips and Enya Umanzor, the hosts of Emergency Intercom, a podcast TMG Studios recently added to its network, released a statement on Instagram saying they are no longer working with TMG and would produce their show independently.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On July 19, Ko made his first public appearance in Las Vegas as he performed a DJ set at Encore’s Beach Club. Videos of his set began circulating online and he was recorded playing a remix of Justin Bieber’s song, “Sorry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBphnZ9jpymnbFdoLxuv9Oep6xllKTEr3nTpp5mq6Sqsaq70maYpaSVnK61tc6nqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./motion-picture-licensing-company-entertainment-industry-1236032735.html><span>←</span><span>Why Motion Picture Licensing Company Is an Invaluable Partner to the Entertainment Industry</span></a>
