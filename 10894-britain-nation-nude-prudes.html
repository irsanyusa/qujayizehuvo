Due to busy lives, stress and money worries sexual appetites have been in decline; the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s, it is said, “<a href=#>came and went</a>”.</p><p>New YouGov research looks at the naked lives of British people, and finds a general sense of embarrassment over bare skin.</p><p>59% of British people are either out-and-out uncomfortable naked, would prefer not to say or are unsure, while 42% are comfortable in the nude. Women (63%) are significantly more likely than men (36%) to feel uncomfortable naked.</p><p>Additionally, very little time is spent naked in Britain. Only 22% say they often walk around the house naked when no one else is in; fewer than one in three (29%) sleep naked in normal temperatures; and three in four (73%) have never gone skinny dipping.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/sex20shy.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>It would be difficult to tell if British people’s attitudes to nakedness were unusual without a comparison, but <a href=#>research by YouGov in America</a> has found that fewer agree their co-citizens are too easily offended by sex and nudity (52%) than do British people (65%). Americans are also more likely to have swum naked (35% compared to 27%).</p><h2>The Naked Rambler</h2><p>Last week the well-known British naturist Stephen Gough lost his case at the European Court of Human Rights after claiming his repeated convictions and imprisonment, totalling more than five years, amounted to repression.</p><p>People tend to think his sentences were too harsh (49% compared to 30% who think they were about right and 5% who say they were too soft), however when looking at cases of naturism they tend to view the public’s right to protection from distress (50%) as more important than the right of expression of naturists (31%).</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWWFeoCMm6mirJGeu266wK2gqKZdo8KlsYypqa6clag%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./books-being-made-into-movies-tv-2018.html><span>←</span><span>Books That Are Being Made Into Movies and TV Shows in 2018</span></a>
