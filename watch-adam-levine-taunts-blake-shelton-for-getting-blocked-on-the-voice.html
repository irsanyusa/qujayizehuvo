He had all of the coaches and members of the audience falling in love with his country twang. Everyone genuinely thought it would be easy for <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a> to seal the deal and get Justin on his team. But Blake was shockingly blocked by one coach and hilariously teased about it afterward.</strong></p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-justin-kilgore-had-the-coaches-fighting-over-him-on-the-voice>Justin Kilgore Had the Coaches Fighting Over Him on ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Justin grew up in a small town in Texas and felt like he was always hiding his true self. When he was 19 years old, Justin came out and decided to move to Austin where he would pursue music full time. Being on The Voice was the chance for him to chase his dreams and really honor his country roots. These are the kind of artists that Blake loves to have on his team.</p><p>Once Blake heard Justin singing, his hand hovered over his button. Just as Blake was about to hit his button, Alicia Keys used her block on him. Kelly Clarkson also turned her chair at the exact same time. Once the three coaches turned around, Blake was angry that he was blocked. Nobody was happier than Adam Levine, his rival. Adam turned his chair at the end of the performance making this a four-chair turn.</p><p>After the performance, Kelly and Adam walked over to Blake’s chair to taunt him for being blocked. Adam mimicked a baby crying and laid on the floor in front of Blake’s chair. He pretended to make snow angels as he slid on the floor. This is a tactic we have seen Adam use numerous times on The Voice, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">falling on the floor in a dramatic fashion. </a>Does anyone else <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">miss him as a coach</a> on the show?</p><p>Justin ended up choosing to be on Team Kelly. He sang “Burning House” with Molly Stevens in the Battle Rounds. He moved on to The Knockouts where he sang “Shameless.” Kelly chose to keep artist Kaleb Lee in the competition and Justin was sent home.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SINGING DUO ON ‘THE VOICE’ IS SO GOOD, ADAM LEVINE FALLS OUT OF HIS CHAIR [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-he-now>Where is He Now?</h3><p>After competing on The Voice, Justin has continued to pursue a career in music. He is on a mission to show people a brand new side of the country genre.</p><p>“My musical game plan is to break through the country music glass ceiling,” Justin said in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with Voice Views.</a> &nbsp;“I’m going to make music that everyone can relate to. Music that is undeniably top-notch. The show was an incredible experience, however, I don’t think America fully got to see what I can really do and what I am capable of. Just bits and pieces.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn2gUgmH-0k/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">THIS COUNTRY ARTIST HAS ‘THE VOICE’ COACH FALLING OUT OF HIS CHAIR BECAUSE…[VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>Fans of The Voice are excited to see what Justin does next since he was such a favorite on the show.
