If I wanted to make Baba my chief of staff, he can be; did you do more than him in the campaign? Ask yourself, how many of you did more than Baba in the campaign? How many?”</p><p>“The young boy was going everywhere and all of us saw him but we decided not to because he wouldn’t want it. My son is satisfied, that’s why. If he is not, I will put him somewhere, there is nothing anybody can do. I will put him there, there is nothing you can do. Is he not my son? Is he not from Ondo state? Has he not worked?”</p><p>The governor also praised his wife, <strong>Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu</strong>, saying Ondo State could not have had a better First Lady.</p><p>“I can never forget the great work that my wife has done in this state, I am not sure you can find a better first lady, someone who has great interest in women, great interest in children, great interest in whatever is good,” he said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I say to people, when I look at my wife, I say, look your wife can follow you because of love but you can’t take the love of her place from her. This is someone who loves you, loves this state and equally love her own state. You can’t find a better First Lady, you can’t see cause she’s committed to women cause. I am not too sure I know many women who are in government today who are there on their own.</p><p>“It’s all her efforts fighting me every-time that you can’t be for men alone, women must be in local government, they must be chairmen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46aop6qlZm8rcGMrJiyq12ptaa%2BxKxkp6eknbavs4yapbKan5nGbq%2FAp2Sdp12es260xGaYqaifnru1v4yhoKxlo6S7bq3SZpqhoZWberCyjKyrmp6WZMa0uNJrqqs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-hamptons-mansion-on-a-58-acre-estate-just-sold-for-more-than-50-off-and-its-a-sign.html><span>←</span><span>A Hamptons mansion on a 58-acre estate just sold for more than 50% off, and it's a sign of the area'</span></a>
