She counts Wales as one of her many homes, as Wilson still holds a big place in her heart.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>While Wales may not be where the two Morgans grew up, both of their jobs play a role in giving back to Welsh communities. For Morgan Specht, this is helping the people he instructs (usually children) develop confidence, critical thinking and social skills through activities such as caving, canoeing, climbing, or mountain walking. For Morgan Morton, it’s about telling stories that make positive changes within communities in Wales, like a project she led looking at how diverse identities are represented in the media at a time when Cardiff Capital Region has £50m investment to <span><span>its media sector into a global hub for media innovation with a focus on green and fair economic growth.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>The two Morgans assimilated to the culture differences long ago. Although while Morgan Specht said he instantly took to the dry sense of humour and “taking the mick” as a way of showing affection, Morgan Morton sees similarities with sensibilities back across the Atlantic:</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>‘At the same&nbsp;time, I feel like southern hospitality and general Welsh friendliness goes hand in hand - although it's more effort to break the ice, the authenticity of the Welsh people reminds me very much of people back home,’ she said.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>They certainly seem to be living up to their Welsh names but where will their loyalties lie when it comes to the World Cup? Morgan Morton says she’ll be backing Wales, going against the interests of her England-supporting long-term boyfriend, Cal. Morgan Specht, meanwhile, is covering all bases of Group B of the World Cup with his family. He’ll be supporting the US, who he’s backed since the 1994 World Cup. His wife Becky will be supporting her native team England, while four-year-old Milo, who was born in Cardiff, will be supporting his home country. And the remaining team in the group?&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>‘We might assign Iran to our one-year-old, Franklin, as the country is having a tough time at the moment and needs some support’, Morgan says.</span></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmrqaZqbKledKtmK2do2TBuLuMmqSeqpmYrq95zKipoJmeqHqurcqipaBllJ6zp7HRnqWcnV2srq2x0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./plan-relance-commerce-pres-d1-mdeu-mobilise-par-la-banque-des-territoires-pour-relancer-lactivite.html><span>←</span><span>prs d1 Md mobilis par la Banque des Territoires pour relancer lactivit conomique et</span></a>
