In fact it's been so extreme that it's been a little overwhelming. Every single corner I walk on in Nairobi I have noticed someone either taking a photo or video while hundreds of times a day I hear people calling out "Jesus!". Kenyan people in general have been very friendly and loving. Until I find this photo of me circulating&nbsp;online. I feel a little concerned by this person's comments. I don't know who wrote it and I don't know if it was just a joke or if they were serous, but it has made me a little uncomfortable to walk in the streets of Nairobi.</p><p>I shouldn't have to respond to such close minded nonsense but a quick message to whoever posted the photo and comment... I AM NOT JESUS! I HAVE NEVER PRETENDED TO BE. I am a traveller who has come to your country as a visitor, i would hope that one day if Jesus does return you treat him with a little more respect than you have treated me.</p><p>To everyone else, you are a beautiful people, I love you!"</p><p>He also had an interview with local TV station,&nbsp;<strong>Kenya NTV.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In the interview, he reveals more about himself, his decision to walk barefoot, grow out his beard and hair.</p><p><strong>Christos</strong> is simply a bearded man, who was born in Australia and travels barefoot around the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8q7HSrqqipp6WtrO7waJkomWRonqvu9NmoZ6rpah6qnnHmq2eZZ6aw6a%2BjKmpnqyVo7GmsIytpmaalWK3pr%2FUrGSlp5%2BgeqK4yKScZquRrsBwxsZpaHGkqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./november.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened on November 12, 2023</span></a>
