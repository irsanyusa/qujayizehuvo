9. Darcy Oake’s dove illusion
In&nbsp;Series 8&nbsp;of&nbsp;Britain’s Got Talent, the audience was shocked by&nbsp;the Canadian illusionist Darcy Oake, who performed several magic tricks with doves. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them, the magician makes a&nbsp;pigeon appear from a&nbsp;burnt feather. How did he&nbsp;do&nbsp;it? Easy.
The feather that Darcy showed&nbsp;us before lightning it&nbsp;up&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;special paper known as&nbsp;flash paper."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Darcy Oake’s dove illusion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cbe/798/be8f625ba9b51aae27c85512b1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Series 8&nbsp;of&nbsp;Britain’s Got Talent, the audience was shocked by&nbsp;the Canadian illusionist Darcy Oake, who performed several magic tricks with doves. In&nbsp;<a href=#>one of&nbsp;them</a>, the magician makes a&nbsp;pigeon appear from a&nbsp;burnt feather. How did he&nbsp;do&nbsp;it? Easy.</p><p>The feather that Darcy showed&nbsp;us before lightning it&nbsp;up&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;special paper known as&nbsp;flash paper. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;commonly used by&nbsp;magicians when they wish to&nbsp;create quick large flashes of&nbsp;fire in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;hide brisk moments of&nbsp;illusion from the audience. That’s exactly what Darcy did&nbsp;— using the fire, he&nbsp;quickly got the pigeon from a&nbsp;secret pocket in&nbsp;his sleeve.</p><p><h2>8. The rising card</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fdd/5a2/cf24e659ca8f8d296286db2a3a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a href=#>this</a> trick an&nbsp;illusionist asks a&nbsp;spectator to&nbsp;randomly choose any card from the deck and place it&nbsp;back. Then the magician makes some magical moves and the spectator’s card is&nbsp;popped out of&nbsp;from the deck. What’s the secret to&nbsp;this illusion?</p><p>When placing the card back in&nbsp;the deck, the magician puts it&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;card with a&nbsp;special mechanism&nbsp;— a&nbsp;small pad, that sticks to&nbsp;the card and moves it&nbsp;upwards. This creates the illusion of&nbsp;it&nbsp;popping out of&nbsp;the deck.</p><p><h2>7. A&nbsp;can on&nbsp;a&nbsp;card</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cc/667/d04c2357449e8eebe24131a9b5.jpg><p>An&nbsp;illusionist takes a&nbsp;card and somehow makes a&nbsp;can stand on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;it. This <a href=#>act</a> might seem impossible, but it’s actually one of&nbsp;the easiest tricks that any beginner can pull off.</p><p>If&nbsp;you take a&nbsp;closer look from another perspective you will see that the card is&nbsp;actually T-shaped. You can easily make this card at&nbsp;home by&nbsp;taking two ordinary cards and sticking them together in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that they create a&nbsp;T-shape. This way it’s pretty easy to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;can or&nbsp;a&nbsp;bottle stand on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the card.</p><p><h2>6. A&nbsp;phone in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bottle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/725/454/5d78ac5fb5b15d8ff9c9f80ca1.jpg><p>The famous street <a href=#>trick </a>goes like this: a&nbsp;magician holds some plastic bottle or&nbsp;any other container in&nbsp;his hand. He&nbsp;shows everyone that it’s an&nbsp;ordinary empty bottle and gives it&nbsp;to&nbsp;someone to&nbsp;prove&nbsp;it. Then the magician asks for someone’s phone. 1-2-3 and the phone has magically passed through the wall of&nbsp;the bottle and ends up&nbsp;inside of&nbsp;it.</p><p>How does it&nbsp;work? There are several ways of&nbsp;doing the trick and one of&nbsp;the most popular is&nbsp;all about the magic equipment. The magician wears a&nbsp;special finger stall with a&nbsp;small, but very sharp blade. After showing the audience that the bottle is&nbsp;whole, he&nbsp;secretly cuts a&nbsp;line in&nbsp;it&nbsp;that’s big enough to&nbsp;push a&nbsp;phone through. No&nbsp;magic here, really. Just a&nbsp;sleight of&nbsp;hand.</p><p><h2>5. Twisting an&nbsp;iPhone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12b/4ba/2e12f0583da65fe396c0bdcde5.jpg><p>The famous magician Dynamo performed this <a href=#>trick</a> in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;people on&nbsp;the streets, leaving the audience in&nbsp;shock. He&nbsp;took an&nbsp;iPhone from one of&nbsp;the spectators and magically rotated its center, leaving it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;half screen and half back state. How is&nbsp;that possible?</p><p>Quite simple, actually. The magician prepared a&nbsp;half back cover of&nbsp;an&nbsp;iPhone and quickly put it&nbsp;over the screen while performing the trick. When Dynamo shows his audience the iPhone, he&nbsp;shows it&nbsp;from the back. Then, covering the device with both hands, he&nbsp;rotates it&nbsp;entirely, showing the screen side with the half back cover over&nbsp;it. From the side it&nbsp;looks like the phone was twisted but we&nbsp;assure you that no&nbsp;iPhone was harmed that day.</p><p><h2>4. Jamie Raven’s lemon trick</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bde/a6a/7fc15a597bae7be8515afa36e7.jpg><p>Another talented magician from Britain’s Got Talent, Jamie Raven, in&nbsp;his final <a href=#>magic</a> trick got a&nbsp;signed note by&nbsp;Alesha, one of&nbsp;the judges, out from a&nbsp;lemon that was kept intact, in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;her since the start of&nbsp;the show. How did he&nbsp;do&nbsp;that?</p><p>When Alesha signed the note, Jamie folded it&nbsp;and showed the audience. While he&nbsp;was folding the note, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;palmed piece of&nbsp;paper in&nbsp;his hands that he&nbsp;instantly switched&nbsp;to. Now, with the signed note still in&nbsp;his hand, he&nbsp;took a&nbsp;bag from Alesha and with the note in&nbsp;his hand reached into the bag, stuffed the lemon, and took it&nbsp;out, showing the audience only one side of&nbsp;it. When Alesha took out the note, he&nbsp;very quickly closed it&nbsp;and put it&nbsp;away because there was actually a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the lemon where he&nbsp;stuffed the note inside.</p><p><h2>3. Turning water into ice in&nbsp;a&nbsp;second</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed9/614/c91cf857bf8b51fbce1bde4a2e.jpg><p>An&nbsp;illusionist pours some liquid into a&nbsp;cup and a&nbsp;moment later it’s turned into a&nbsp;cube of&nbsp;ice.</p><p>The <a href=#>trick </a>here lies in&nbsp;the cup which already contains a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;ice along with a&nbsp;sponge that’s the same color as&nbsp;the cup. The sponge is&nbsp;fixed to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the cup and will absorb the water that is&nbsp;poured&nbsp;in. So&nbsp;when the magician turns the cup upside down, the ice falls out into his hand while the water remains in&nbsp;the sponge.</p><p><h2>2. Passing through the wall</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc5/f76/1b9c365a29a320bc9e2553dfad.jpg><p>There’s a&nbsp;<a href=#>wall</a> on&nbsp;the stage that looks and feels very realistic. A&nbsp;magician approaches the wall from one side and the assistants hide him with special screens on&nbsp;wheels. The exact same construction is&nbsp;put on&nbsp;another side of&nbsp;the wall. A&nbsp;few seconds later the magician appears on&nbsp;the opposite side of&nbsp;the wall.</p><p>Although it&nbsp;may seem like Hogwarts magic, the performance is&nbsp;quite easy. There’s a&nbsp;special v-shaped tunnel going under the wall. That is&nbsp;why the spectators who study the wall and how solid it&nbsp;is, don’t find anything&nbsp;— the wall is&nbsp;ok, the floor is&nbsp;not. The magician needs just a&nbsp;fraction of&nbsp;a&nbsp;second to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through the small tunnel going under the wall and stand on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>1. David Copperfield’s death saw</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd3/2ad/f13c955ae38510c13e3c738cea.jpg><p>David Copperfield is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best-known classic magicians ever. One of&nbsp;his favorite <a href=#>tricks</a> was the death saw magic act in&nbsp;where he&nbsp;split himself in&nbsp;half using a&nbsp;giant saw blade.</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;perform the illusion, Copperfield used an&nbsp;assistant for the latter part of&nbsp;his body. Together they seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just a&nbsp;single person. The secret of&nbsp;this trick is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the table beneath and the tiny gap between the tables that the saw blade can easily pass through. Copperfield’s legs were bent into the table, and the assistant’s upper body was hidden in&nbsp;the table below.</p><p>As&nbsp;you see, magic is&nbsp;much easier than it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be. With good preparation, you could do&nbsp;it&nbsp;yourself. Which of&nbsp;the tricks out of&nbsp;our list would you try to&nbsp;perform?
