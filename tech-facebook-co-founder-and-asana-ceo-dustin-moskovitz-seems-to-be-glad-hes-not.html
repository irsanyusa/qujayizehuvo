Moskovitz has been the CEO of Asana —</p><p>“I do think it’s nice to have a straightforward business model where you create something valuable for companies and they pay you for it," Moskovitz told us. "There’s a lot fewer rough edges, I guess, since we’re not a content platform. We’re really providing infrastructure."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The problematic position Facebook finds itself in today — a company that makes its money from user data in a social climate where more people are increasingly concerned about their privacy — is perhaps why Moskovitz has stayed at Asana and in the enterprise space for more than a decade.</p><p>When asked his thoughts on Facebook's current situation, especially as it relates to privacy issues, Moskovitz deflected, saying: "Asana is a fast-growing business. We have 400 employees. My energy and attention is pretty much 100% consumed with this project so I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about consumer net.”</p><p>Perhaps that's true.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Asana did <a href=# id=a9d6656d-38d4-5a4a-bee9-24d634ef9cc4>just raise a $50 million Series E</a>, bringing its valuation to $1.5 billion. The company is growing internationally — opening up an Australia office next week and a Japan office next year — and says its revenue is growing 90% year-over-year. Moskovitz also tells us Asana plans to increase its team of 400 to 600 by the end of 2019.</p><p>But for someone who <a href=# id=5230ff58-ba36-512e-9cc2-95543f486999>learned PHP in his dorm room</a> to help build an early version of "thefacebook.com," it's hard to imagine Moskovitz doesn't spend at least some of his time reflecting on the influence, good and bad, of the product he created almost 15 years ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWekmrCpecWamp6an6S4bq%2FOZp2orZ6ZsrN5wKebZpmjlruiecKepmacpajBqrqMpqaso5%2BrtrXGjKycnqWjYsGwecGeZKCkkZl6qbHSZqWorF%2BXf6%2B9mJ1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./davido-e-money-dbanj-others-storm-socialite-obi-cubanas-mums-burial.html><span>←</span><span>Davido, E-Money, D'banj others storm socialite Obi Cubana's mum's burial</span></a>
