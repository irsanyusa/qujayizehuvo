As many as 400 lawmakers backed the legislation, while 10 opposed it and five members either abstained or didn’t vote, after more than three hours of debate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>‘Nobody Is Taking Away My Child.’ What Thailand’s Push for Marriage Equality Means for One Family</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The bill now heads to the upper-house Senate, which is set to review it on April 2. It will then be endorsed by the King and published in the Royal Gazette. The amendments will take effect 120 days later.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When the changes come into force, Thailand will recognize marriage registrations of same-sex partners aged 18 and above, along with their rights to inheritance, tax allowances and child adoption, among others. Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s administration has made it a signature issue, and advocates say it would also burnish Thailand’s reputation as an LGBTQ-friendly tourist destination.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Thailand’s New Prime Minister Is Getting Down to Business. But Can He Heal His Nation?</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This will not take away any rights from men and women, and will instead extend the rights to LGBTQ groups,” said Danuphorn Punnakanta, head of a panel of lawmakers that steered the bill. “We seek to return to them the rights that they have lost.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The landmark legislation seeks to formally change the composition of a marriage from “a man and a woman” to “two individuals,” and change the official legal status from “husband and wife” to “married couple.” The move goes further than attempts by previous Thai administrations, which sought to grant equal rights for same-sex couples by formalizing civil partnerships but stopped short of recognizing their marriage.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thailand will become the third place in Asia to recognize same-sex marriage, after Taiwan and Nepal, and rank among some 40 countries around the world to guarantee equal marital rights.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>What Topped Asia’s Legal Agenda in 2023—From Same-Sex Marriage to the Death Penalty</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Recent efforts elsewhere in the region have had mixed results. Hong Kong has yet to comply with a 2023 court order to establish laws recognizing same-sex partnerships, and India’s Supreme Court refused to legalize same-sex marriage, saying it’s an issue for parliament to consider.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">LGBTQ activists in Thailand have fought for over a decade for the same rights to marry as heterosexual couples. Although Thai laws have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">protected</a>&nbsp;LGBTQ people from most kinds of discrimination since 2015, attempts to formalize marriage rights had stalled.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2021, the Constitutional Court upheld the law recognizing marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. Last year, a bill to recognize same-sex civil partnerships failed to clear parliament ahead of elections.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Tourism boost</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Legalizing same-sex marriage could also have positive impact on tourism, which contributes about 12% to the nation’s $500 billion economy. In 2019, before the pandemic froze international tourism, LGBTQ travel to Thailand <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">generated</a> about $6.5 billion, or 1.2% of gross domestic product, according to industry consultant LGBT Capital.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Formal recognition could boost the reputation of a place already considered one of Asia’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best</a>&nbsp;for LGBTQ visitors, allowing it to benefit from the “pink economy,” said Wittaya Luangsasipong, managing director of Siam Pride, an LGBTQ-friendly travel agency in Bangkok.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It will become a selling point for Thailand and raise our strength in the global stage,” Wittaya said. “It will create a relaxed and safe atmosphere and attract more and more LGBTQ visitors. We could also see more weddings by LGBTQ couples, which could generate income across industries and local communities.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many same-sex couples will also consider moving back or relocating to Thailand for work, he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Srettha’s government has vowed to push ahead with more progressive laws, including legislations to recognize gender identity and legalize prostitution. The health ministry has also proposed legalizing commercial surrogacy to allow LGBTQ couples to adopt children. Thailand is seeking to host the WorldPride events in Bangkok in 2028.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The marriage equality bill is just the first step. There are many more to come,” said Danuphorn of the ruling Pheu Thai Party. A gender identity bill will likely be proposed in the next sitting of the parliament that will begin in July, he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZlhnOAjq2fmqGclruledKapJ5lo5rFbrnAq6mimZeaeq2t1manmqqcnq6usc2tZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-brief-history-of-sex-at-the-olympics.html><span>←</span><span>Sochi's Tinder-Gate and a History of Sex at the Olympics</span></a>
