Rick Scott warned. The hurricane is expected to bring sustained winds of more than 145 mph and storm surge of up to 14 feet, according to the National Hurricane Center.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bettes on Wednesday posted a video of Hurricane Michael beginning to make landfall in Apalachicola, showing storm surge and loud, rough winds.
