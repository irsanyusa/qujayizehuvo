Russia and the EU countries are equally hurt," Radev said during the campaign.</p><p>Bulgaria's membership into the <strong>EU</strong> and <strong>NATO</strong> "has no alternative but it does not necessarily mean that we must declare ourselves enemies of Russia", he added.</p><p>He also shocked observers by repeatedly saying that Crimea "is de jure Ukrainian but de facto Russian".</p><p>Radev is married and a father of teenage daughter and son from a previous marriage. He speaks English, German and Russian.</p><p>He will be sworn in on January 22 for a five-year term in office.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXyzwcyepWaqkZmyt3nBrqOgmaKerrR5zZ6uZqqlqMCwvMeio55loKeytLXDnqWtZ2idsnLFwrA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-of-tv-and-movies-hottest-villains-807567.html><span>←</span><span>8 of TV and Movies Hottest Villains</span></a>
