Online or at my shows. It is the opposite of what I want and it disturbs me that anyone would think there is room for this in this community. I will not tolerate it,” Charli wrote on her Instagram story.</p><p>Earlier this month, Charli’s fans also attacked Swift when she released a U.K. exclusive digital version of her album “The Tortured Poets Department,” because it was the same week that Charli’s latest album, “Brat” was released. Fans speculate that it blocked Charli’s chance at reaching the top spot on the U.K.’s Official Charts.</p><p>Rumors also starting swirling that the song “Sympathy is a knife” on “Brat” was written about Swift. Charli has hinted before how the song was inspired by an unnamed girl who “taps myinsecurities.”</p><p>Lyrics from the song read, “Don’tknow if it’sreal or if I’m spiraling…One voicetells me that they laugh. George says I’m just paranoid…Don’t wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend’s show. Fingers crossed behind my back. I hope they break up quick.”</p><p>The reasoning behind this is that Charil is engaged to The 1975’s drummer, George Daniel and Swift used to date their lead singer Matty Healy.</p><p>Charli was also an opener alongside Camila Cabello for Swift on her 2018 Reputation Tour, and previously said after that experience, she was done opening for other artists. “I’m really grateful that [Taylor] asked me on that tour. But as an artist, it kind of felt like I was getting up on stage and waving to 5-year-olds,” she said. “I need to just own my own f–king s–t finally.”</p><p>However, Charli has never addressed the rumors or commented negatively about Swift following the release of “Brat.”</p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traKWlqLake82erqxnk52us7jIZq%2BcsF2Yrq240mamrqxdm66vv4ycn5qmpJ67qHnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa1koqtdmbKisIxqbGtqZGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./un-guide-pour-inclure-les-sports-de-nature-dans-le-plui.html><span>←</span><span>Un guide pour inclure les sports de nature dans le PLUi</span></a>
