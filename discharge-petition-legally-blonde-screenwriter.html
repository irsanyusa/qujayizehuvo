In fact, its depiction of an arcane legislative maneuver has been hailed as one of the most accurate moments in movies about Congress.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now that the House of Representatives is <a href=# rel=noopener>close to actually following that blueprint</a>, screenwriter Kate Kondell said she’s proud to have played a role in “introducing mainstream America to this pretty esoteric legislative strategy.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Tuesday, House Republicans came within a handful of votes of successfully forcing a vote on immigration bills using something known as a <a href=#>“discharge petition,”</a> essentially a Hail Mary pass to get around Speaker Paul Ryan, who would not allow the bills to come to the floor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If Republicans backing the maneuver can gather 218 signatures, they’ll force votes on a group of bills which would extend protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Legally Blonde” aside, discharge petitions are quite rare — and typically not successful. A <a href=# rel=noopener>2003 study by the Congressional Research Service</a> found that only 16% of discharge petition attempts were either completed or indirectly led to legislation being considered.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In that sense, they’re not that dissimilar from the talking filibuster that Sen. Jefferson Smith uses in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” an unusual move popularized by a movie, a comparison Kondell herself has made in the past.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the movie, Woods, played by Reese Witherspoon, discovers that a prominent makeup company is using the mother of her dog, Bruiser, for cosmetic testing, but when her anti-animal testing bill is blocked by a House committee, she gathers enough signatures on a discharge petition to force a vote.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The screenwriter says she didn’t start out as a legislative expert. All she knew was that she needed to give her main character an obstacle.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“From what I recall, we basically wanted Elle Woods to find herself in a real legislative pickle,” she explained. “We needed to put her in a situation where she faced seemingly insurmountable legislative odds and roadblocks and came out the other side with a bill passed into law.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To figure out what exactly that scenario would be, Kondell reached out to someone who, she says, “knew a lot more about such things than I did.” Tim Groseclose, a current professor at George Mason University, was a colleague of her husband at the time at Stanford University.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Groseclose recalled that over a handful of meetings over coffee, he suggested a number of ideas, including the discharge petition among them. His favorite suggestion was using a legislative rider — amending another bill with a proposal that wouldn’t necessarily pass on its own — but Kandell didn’t think it was dramatic enough.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Fortunately, Kate could see further than I could,” he laughs. “She realized that the discharge petition would be a really good humor device for the movie. … It was pink and scented. You couldn’t do that with any of the other tactics.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In thanks, Kondell named the character who suggests the discharge petition in the movie Timothy, and Groseclose has often shown the scene to his students in class as an example of a political turning point when it seems like there’s no way forward.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As his character tells Woods in the movie: “I mean, none of us ever thought one person could make a difference until you came along.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZua2FlgXODjp2grJuYlr%2BosYypnK2hpJ68r3nLnp6apJyueqO4zqebnmWjmL%2Bmsc2wqaKslad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vegans-germany.html><span>←</span><span>Vegans and vegetarians in Germany: A quick guide</span></a>
