Fans concluded that the song was about Joshua and Sabrina, as Rodrigo refers to a blonde girl in the lyrics.</p><p class=align-left>Two weeks later, Sabrina released a single, <i>Skin</i>, which seemed to respond to Rodrigo’s single. Her lyrics seemed to address the ‘blonde girl’ remark and to make veiled driving references, considering the title of Rodrigo’s song.</p><p class=align-left>Amidst all the drama, Bassett came forth in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ET Canada</a>, asking fans to focus on the music.
