Let loved ones spread the word on your behalf<br></strong>“You have to have family or social support when you’re dealing with hard emotions,” said Eve Sturges, a therapist who canceled her wedding just eight weeks before the ceremony. Sturges’ mother sent postcards to the attendees, which read, “The wedding of Eve and Jim is postponed indefinitely. Thank you for your love and support.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><i>Follow Motto on Facebook.</i></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2.

Don’t shy away from other weddings<br></strong>Chances are, if you’re at the point in your life where you’re ready to get married, you have a bunch of friends in the same boat. Your own cancellation shouldn’t mean you skip out on other weddings. “On the date of her own canceled wedding, Ms. Becker, who eventually broke up with her fiancé, had been invited to a wedding of a summer-camp friend. She didn’t want to go because she was so emotional about the date, but another friend, who had recently gone through his own breakup, persuaded her that they should go together. He is now her husband and the father to their 2-year-old son,” the Times reported.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read the full story at the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZta2RofXOEjpyYp5uVoXq4scOdoKefXZq7qK3GnqSepqRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./42363-what-do-twitter-users-think-elon-musk-buying-platf.html><span>←</span><span>What do Twitter users think of Elon Musk buying the platform?</span></a>
