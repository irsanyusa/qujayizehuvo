Although there are countless costumes out there, these 12 models have the perfect balance of long-lasting comfort and an eye-catching design everyone will admire. While my favorite is the simple, yet lovable <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kitan Club Bear Cap</a>, every dog is different, so read on to find which of the 2023’s most charming and coziest costumes is the best choice for your dog.</p><h2 id=our-top-dog-halloween-costume-picks>Our top dog Halloween costume picks</h2><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Frisco Stegosaurus Costume</a></h3><p>Dinosaurs are always in style, and Frisco’s charming stegosaurus costume is a versatile pick for Jurassic Park fans. This two-piece model is available in sizes small enough for toy breeds to comfortably wear, to XXL for golden retrievers and other practically stegosaurus-sized dogs. Although some pets dislike headwear, the average dog will appreciate the scaly dinosaur body and tail for its plush interior and long sleeves that make it difficult to accidentally step out of during a walk.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Frisco Skunk Dog Costume</a></h3><p>Everyone knows your spoiled-rotten dog is a little stinker, so why not lean into that this Halloween? This skunk costume is available in sizes small through XXL, and its upright tail and fluffy faux black and white fur will look adorable. This durable, ultra-soft hoodie-like costume is cozy enough to be worn all year as a windbreaker for chilly days. Even if your dog doesn’t like their ears covered, the skunk costume may be an exception, since there’s plenty of room in its spacious striped hood.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Frisco Bat Dog Cape</a></h3><p>Halloween trends come and go, but a vampire’s cape offers timeless appeal. Featuring a snug, yet soft fit, these harness-like vampire capes are sold in sizes small through XXL to easily fit most party animals. The adorable patterned orange underside and boney bat wings caught my attention, but this cape is a winner because of its adjustable hook and loop closures, and the perfect fit they provide dogs.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Rubie's Shark Fin Dog Costume</a></h3><p>As fun as it would be to dress up every dog for Halloween, some pets just don’t feel comfortable wearing an elaborate getup. But even the most finicky puppies will love this fun, yet simple, shark costume. Available in small/medium and medium/large sizes, this costume feels just like the walking harness they’re used to, but with an exciting, sharky twist. The fin is lightweight and out of the way so your little shark won’t even notice it, but keep in mind that these costumes run on the smaller side—so if your dog is medium-sized, get the bigger size just to be safe.</p><p><h3 class=title>Rubie's Shark Fin Dog Costume</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Fetch For Pets Star Wars Chewbacca Dog Harness</a></h3><p>Buddy costumes are always a treat and your little doggie always has your back, so why not have them be the Chewbacca to your Han Solo this Halloween? This small, harness-like costume is breathable, light, durable, and includes a pair of metal loops on the back to effortlessly attach a leash. Whether your puppy feels like a Wookie year-round or just on the holidays, this Star Wars costume is easily the most practical Halloween costume of the year.</p><p><h3 class=title>Star Wars for Pets Chewbacca Cosplay Dog Harness for Small Dogs, Small (S) | Brown Small Dog Harness is Cute No Pull Dog Harness | Merch for Dogs or Pet Costume</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Frisco Front-Walking Sloth Dog Costume</a></h3><p>If your dog is a bit of a slug throughout the year, it’s time to celebrate their laziness with this hilarious sloth costume! This sweet outfit includes a matching sloth-faced cap and front body piece that is sure to get smiles from everyone as its lanky sloth arms wiggle with each step. Seeing your puppy become a sloth for Halloween is cute, but they’ll appreciate the front piece’s extra-soft and featherweight feel. In other words, they won’t mind wearing it throughout the evening.</p><p><h3 class=title>Frisco Front Walking Sloth Dog & Cat Costume, X-Large</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Frisco Formal Dog Tuxedo</a></h3><p>Keep it classy with this adorable tuxedo costume this Halloween. I’m a big fan of highly adjustable dog costumes, and this tux’s dual Velcro closures ensure it’s a comfortable costume from the moment you slide it over their head, and with sizes ranging from extra-small to XXXL, it’s easy to find the best fit for your suave canine companion. The cherry on top are this tuxedo’s charming rear buttons, slick vest, and of course, its darling matching bowtie.</p><p><h3 class=title>Frisco Formal Dog & Cat Tuxedo, Black, Large</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Rubie's Hamburger Dog Costume</a></h3><p>If you’re going to be silly this Halloween, why not go all out and make your dog a walking hamburger? Rubie’s burger costume is featherweight and more durable than you may expect, so it’ll easily survive multiple Halloweens if you take care of it. Its hook and loop closures make dressing and securing the burger onto your dog a breeze—but consider buying a slightly larger burger, because these costumes run small.</p><p><h3 class=title>Rubie's Hamburger Dog Costume, Large</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Frisco Glow in the Dark Skeleton Dog & Cat Costume</a></h3><p>Some of the best Halloween costumes may seem simple at first glance, but hide a spooky surprise, like this skeleton costume. Its glowing green ribs are the perfect way to impress all your trick-or-treaters! These are made in sizes small through XXL, so every dog can be a boney buddy. Thanks to its dual Velcro closures on the chest and underside, it makes quick work of getting the perfect level of comfort for your dog.</p><p><h3 class=title>Frisco Glow in the Dark Skeleton Dog & Cat Costume, Medium</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>California Costumes Pet Spider Pup</a></h3><p>What better way to get a rise out of your Halloween party guests than having a giant fuzzy spider greet them upon arrival? This extra-creative dog costume is available in sizes extra-small through large, and its comfortable harness-like spider body is a snap to put on. Although breeds with tall,pointy ears may not appreciate the four-eyed hood, most dogs won’t mind wandering and begging for snacks alongside eight unobtrusive fuzzy spider legs this Halloween. Just make sure friends and family don’t end up overfeeding your adorable tarantula!</p><p><h3 class=title>California Costumes Pet Spider Pup Dog Costume Costume</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Rubie's Puppy Latte Costume</a></h3><p>Dog owners who live on caffeine and pumpkin spice all fall long will love this super-sweet latte Halloween costume. Its cup section is secured by a Velcro latch to ensure this snug jacket-like costume is at its comfiest, while the foam and straw hat is a gentle elastic band. The hat is surprisingly sturdy, and the fuzzy, warm cup costume is an excellent pick for anyone celebrating Halloween in a cooler climate.</p><p><h3 class=title>Rubie's Puppy Latte Pet Costume, Medium</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Kitan Club Teddy Bear Cap</a></h3><p>Yes, these adorable little hats are modeled by cats, but if you’re looking for a simple, lightweight, and absolutely cute costume idea for your extra-small dog, Kitan Club has you covered. Each box contains one of four fuzzy little bear caps, and while you can’t pick between the six mystery colors you’ll receive, they’re all equally cozy and easy to put onto tiny dogs. In addition, these mini-costumes are affordable at just under $8 a pop, and if turning your little sweetheart into a bear for Halloween isn’t your thing, the Japanese novelty brand offers a selection of other fun choices including bunny, fruit, and flower-themed pet caps to choose from.</p><p><h3 class=title>Kitan Club Cat Cap - Pet Hat Blind Box Includes 1 of 6 Cute Styles - Soft, Comfortable - Authentic Japanese Kawaii Design - Animal-Safe Materials, Premium Quality (Bear)</h3></p><p>The information presented here is created independently from the TIME editorial staff.
