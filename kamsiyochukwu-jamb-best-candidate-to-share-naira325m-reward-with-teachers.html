As this young girl has done well, we want other young ladies to do the same and reduce this country’s problem. The youths are our only hope in this country."</p><p>“I am happy that out of the 1.6 million students that sat the examination, she came first. My heart is gladdened. I am particularly happy because she came from Amish town, Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State.</p><p>'Amish town was where the civil war ended, where (former president Olusegun) Obasanjo took the surrender of Biafra; that means we are a peace-loving town. People like me and this girl are projecting our village in good light. If we as parents have suffered to send our kids to school, they have to do something to make us happy,” He added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXysrcysoLKnk53CrMPUZqGapZJir6a%2F02aamqaUnrGiwMRmq6hlo52us7GMp5iiqpFof3a5jKucsJmimXq4tdOhZK2dkZi1pr7SaKSvq5pog6w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bangalore-australian-goddess-tattoo-hindu-mob.html><span>←</span><span>Indian Mob Threatens Australian Man for Hindu Goddess Tattoo</span></a>
