She emphasised her mother's typical Nigerian attitude, noting that her mom cares about how and where she is.</p><p>Despite achieving celebrity status, Ayra Starr spoke on her mother's protective nature, illustrating that certain aspects of her life remain firmly grounded in the realm of a typical Nigerian family. The singer humorously recounted instances where her mother would call late at night to ensure her safety during events and performances.</p><p>"My mom still calls me at 2:00 a.m. If I have a show she'd call me and be like 'You're still there? You haven't left?' and I'd be like 'Mummy I have a show. They paid me to be here,' then she'd tell me 'Just make sure you go home and be careful," she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The musician discussed her approach to luxury items and the ever-present influence of her Nigerian mother on her choices and how she cares little for luxury items.</p><p>"To be honest I don't really care too much about cars and all of that. Oh there's this bag I want. it's not as if I can't afford it. It's just that if I try to buy it, I need my mom to get to the point where she doesn't care what I spend my money on. But if I try it now she's just going to be like you spend this much on a bag. She's very much a Nigerian mum," said Ayra Starr.</p><p>Starr painted a vivid picture of her mom's concern, mentioning how she checks in on her well-being, asks about her sleep, and even contacts her managers to ensure she is safe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGamsV2iwq55yKxkrKyZoblurYynoKCdop6ur3nMrqRmnaaau27Ax6isoKBdnrpussCmpq6rXZbGs62MrKuaqqJksat%2FymqbbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deaths.html><span>←</span><span>Famous People Who Died in 2019 (Part 2)</span></a>
