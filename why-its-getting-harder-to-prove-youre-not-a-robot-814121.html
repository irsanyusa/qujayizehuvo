But, before you do&nbsp;it&nbsp;— here’s a&nbsp;captcha. Oh&nbsp;man, this one’s tricky&nbsp;— choose any and every image that has firetrucks in&nbsp;it.</p><p>So, you select the 3&nbsp;you think are right but EHHH, <strong>wrong</strong>. You were certain that there was a&nbsp;firetruck in&nbsp;that last image. So, you try again. It’s not until the 4th attempt that you’re finally done. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;just&nbsp;me, or&nbsp;<strong>are captchas getting harder</strong>?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/79e/639/2bfd035e6ca7fa4dc94f96d17e.png><p>Captcha tests are specifically designed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;guard against millions of&nbsp;bots out there. It&nbsp;stands for the<strong> Completely Automated Public Turing Test to&nbsp;tell Computers and Humans Apart</strong>. Bots are getting better at&nbsp;solving captchas than we&nbsp;are, and there are hundreds if&nbsp;not thousands of&nbsp;captchas tests already on&nbsp;the Internet.</p><p>Initially, captcha was developed so&nbsp;that any human can pass&nbsp;it, and every computer will fail at&nbsp;it. Something we’re really good at&nbsp;is&nbsp;reading. Even when it’s not easy, we&nbsp;can still make out the words. Imagine you’re going down the highway, and you look through your window. Trees go&nbsp;by&nbsp;you before you can even make out their shapes.</p><p>But there’s a&nbsp;sign-up ahead, and you instantly read&nbsp;it. Even if&nbsp;the letters are a&nbsp;bit distorted, we&nbsp;can still read what it&nbsp;says. When captcha came to&nbsp;be, computers weren’t all that good at&nbsp;reading. So, captcha’s early forms were simply distorted text. You’d have a&nbsp;few letters in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you, and it’d be&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;puzzle them together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/750/ab8/db882952d9b2f90746d19144bc.png><p>Some say there was a&nbsp;little room for error because some letters, even though they’re different, still look really similar. The test has changed over time. And now, <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong> is&nbsp;the most dominant form of&nbsp;<strong>captcha</strong>. It&nbsp;digitizes the text of&nbsp;old newspapers and books and places two words in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you.</p><p>The first word is&nbsp;generated by&nbsp;the computer, and it’s the word the computer knows is&nbsp;right. The second one is&nbsp;the digitized word. The computer simply assumes it’s correct. It&nbsp;double-checks it&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving other people trying to&nbsp;enter the website the same test. It’s only when a&nbsp;few people give the same “right” answer that the word is&nbsp;considered correct.</p><p>It&nbsp;still might’ve taken&nbsp;us a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;get the test right, and computers got so&nbsp;good at&nbsp;this, they could do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye. While people took their own captcha tests, computers kept constantly learning what these distorted words meant. And they became better at&nbsp;solving captchas than&nbsp;us. People fed up&nbsp;with captchas were so&nbsp;frustrated they’d use any technology that would let them bypass it&nbsp;or&nbsp;fill it&nbsp;out for them.</p><p>So, captchas evolved yet again into image captchas. This time, we&nbsp;were the ones teaching computers how to&nbsp;identify these images or&nbsp;objects so&nbsp;that they could then test to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;we’re hidden bots or&nbsp;just regular humans. But again, computers and bots learned from this and became better at&nbsp;it&nbsp;than&nbsp;us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/113/6e7/852f475717aca39b3750432110.png><p>Now, there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<strong>invisible captcha</strong>. It&nbsp;was sort of&nbsp;reset. Simply put, <a href=# title=AI data-link=tag>AI</a>&nbsp;tracks your behavior to&nbsp;determine if&nbsp;you’re human or&nbsp;not. It&nbsp;runs in&nbsp;the background of&nbsp;a&nbsp;website, and when you move your mouse, it&nbsp;knows. Just like it&nbsp;knows how long you take to&nbsp;click on&nbsp;something.</p><p>If&nbsp;you pass the “human” test, chances are you’re just going to&nbsp;have the best and easiest captcha. The one where you have to&nbsp;click “<strong>I’m not a&nbsp;robot</strong>” captcha. Some bots can be&nbsp;so&nbsp;sophisticated they look and act like humans on&nbsp;the Internet. Here’s how you can identify some of&nbsp;them.</p><p>First off, not all bots are bad. Search engines and antiviruses use bots to&nbsp;analyze and gather data from the Internet. But some bots are up&nbsp;to&nbsp;no&nbsp;good, like spreading misinformation or&nbsp;messing with your personal info. When you think an&nbsp;account on&nbsp;social media is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bot, you can check their user profile. Most of&nbsp;them will lack a&nbsp;photo, and they won’t have anything written in&nbsp;their biography.</p><p>Bots still can’t mimic the way we&nbsp;talk very well. So, if&nbsp;someone’s responses are repetitive, or&nbsp;they sound like they’re right out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hand guide, chances are you’re talking to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bot. Tell them a&nbsp;joke! If&nbsp;they don’t understand it&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;bot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/acf/902/2c2731559699ab4d73631803f3.png><p>Usually, they’re programmed by&nbsp;someone with a&nbsp;certain topic in&nbsp;mind, like telling someone about their favorite singer! If&nbsp;they can’t talk about anything else, they also might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bot. Or, just a&nbsp;really big fan.</p><p>There are tons of&nbsp;bots on&nbsp;Twitter. They repost the same links over and over, which can also be&nbsp;a&nbsp;telltale sign. Look at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;their posts. If&nbsp;they tweet nonstop, and it&nbsp;seems like they never sleep, they might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bot account. There are other things out there to&nbsp;get you, like viruses and malware!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e83/3d8/2e1c5a59088e1692229d1b66bb.png><p>To&nbsp;stay safer when you’re surfing the net, check if&nbsp;the website’s connection is&nbsp;safe. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;closed lock before <strong>HTTPS</strong>, it’s secure. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;bad sign. Your browser might warn you, too, with a&nbsp;bright red sign and an&nbsp;exclamation mark where the lock should&nbsp;be.</p><p>Use a&nbsp;<strong>complex password</strong>.<strong> </strong>Things like your Birthday or&nbsp;your phone number might be&nbsp;too easy to&nbsp;guess. Don’t just write <strong>qwerty</strong>, either. Think of&nbsp;capital and lowercase letters, together with different symbols. Here’s a&nbsp;good idea of&nbsp;a&nbsp;password: <strong>mXPq*/a</strong> [m&nbsp;x&nbsp;s&nbsp;p&nbsp;q&nbsp;asterisk slash&nbsp;a].</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/333/42d/88c5745712bf422f269537bedd.png><p>Viruses are a&nbsp;danger to&nbsp;our computers, too. Here’s how you can tell if&nbsp;yours is&nbsp;infected. Your cursor will randomly start moving on&nbsp;its own. It’ll click programs or&nbsp;any links that you don’t want&nbsp;to.</p><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;clear sign your computer is&nbsp;being controlled remotely. Try to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the virus with the help of&nbsp;an&nbsp;antivirus or&nbsp;even anti-malware. But if&nbsp;you can’t, chances are you’re going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;full reset of&nbsp;everything that’s on&nbsp;your computer, so&nbsp;you can stay protected.</p><p>Pop-up pages can happen when you’re browsing through the web, but when you get them even with the web browser closed, that’s a&nbsp;red flag. Close them instantly, and never click on&nbsp;any links. Out of&nbsp;nowhere, new programs start showing&nbsp;up. You’ve never installed them, though. Check what they’re up&nbsp;to&nbsp;with the help of&nbsp;Microsoft’s process explorer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cb6/2e5/21f8e85524b84c16d5ab5d42b2.png><p>You’ve got plenty of&nbsp;spam emails, but now you’re the one sending them without even realizing&nbsp;it. This might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign that your sensitive info has been compromised. Change your passwords as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you can.</p><p>Even worse, you might be&nbsp;locked out of&nbsp;your accounts entirely. Think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;recover them in&nbsp;case this happens. Check your bank statements often.</p><p>If&nbsp;you notice any suspicious or&nbsp;fraudulent transactions you haven’t authorized, talk to&nbsp;your bank to&nbsp;see what’s happening&nbsp;— a&nbsp;cybercriminal might be&nbsp;behind this.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyiq6xll5rBtbXNoGShmaKZsrN506hkqaqfq7Juxc6uqZ5lnqTBbq2Mq6abp6RihXKAkGtoaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-cowell-contributes-to-documentary-about-ukrainian-got-talent-contestants.html><span>←</span><span>Simon Cowell Contributes to Documentary About Ukrainian 'Got Talent' Contestants</span></a>
