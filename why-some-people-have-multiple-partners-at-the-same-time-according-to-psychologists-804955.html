In&nbsp;these arrangements, partners are usually aware that each of&nbsp;them has other relationships. This means that polyamory is&nbsp;not actually cheating, but having an&nbsp;open, honest relationship with your partner.</p><p>People usually confuse swinging and polyamory, however, the latter one is&nbsp;not just about <a href=# title=intimacy data-link=tag>intimacy</a>, but also a&nbsp;romantic relationship.</p><p><h2>Open relationships can make some people happy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/383/c1d/f6f8eb5e58aff68e45ebb37d74.jpg><p>In&nbsp;monogamous couples, people cannot imagine the fact that their partner may be&nbsp;dating someone else. However, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>research</a> shows that <strong>polyamorous couples are quite happy with their arrangements</strong>. Reportedly people in&nbsp;open relationships are just as&nbsp;happy and satisfied with their relationships as&nbsp;people who choose monogamy. What is&nbsp;more interesting is&nbsp;that <strong>polyamorous people even have a&nbsp;higher level of&nbsp;trust</strong> and are less jealous than monogamous people.</p><p><h2>Polyamory involves more communication.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b1/641/f74d605bfea15799f19529f297.jpg><p>Talking to&nbsp;your partner is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crucial <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>factor</a> in&nbsp;polyamorous relationships. Since couples should be&nbsp;open and honest with each other about everything to&nbsp;maintain trust, this makes them even closer. So&nbsp;having a&nbsp;non-monogamous arrangement involves a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;conversations which makes the partners’ relationships deeper and stronger. Studies even show that<strong> polyamorous people have </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>better</strong></a><strong> <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> skills.</strong></p><p><h2>Different partners may satisfy different needs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cd/df3/09cb8b503a9f6eb687b3f19d96.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>psychological</a> profiles of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;open relationships suggest that <strong>they may have more emotional needs that cannot be&nbsp;satisfied by&nbsp;a&nbsp;single person</strong>. Sometimes it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;person who can give you both and hence non-monogamous people satisfy different needs in&nbsp;different relationships.</p><p><h2>Polyamory is&nbsp;not suitable for everyone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a2/61d/9fdcb35575bac68ef0c4c8c074.jpg><p>Some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proponents</a> of&nbsp;polyamory believe that the value of&nbsp;the classic relationship between 2&nbsp;partners is&nbsp;outdated. Sometimes young people become polyamorous because they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>want</a> to&nbsp;try a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;connection. And after gaining new experience they often return to&nbsp;monogamy. Polyamory is&nbsp;also chosen by&nbsp;those who do&nbsp;not want to&nbsp;end their relationship if&nbsp;they meet a&nbsp;new potential partner.</p><p><h2>The cons of&nbsp;polyamory</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/545/84e/ef9e2a56f087afadadba00355e.jpg><p>Aside from the potential benefits, this kind of&nbsp;relationship may also have some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cons</a>. First of&nbsp;all, if&nbsp;you are not ready for this, you may experience jealousy and perceive the new connection of&nbsp;your partner painfully. Second, if&nbsp;you practice polyamory it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;harder for you to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> because not all partners can agree on&nbsp;that issue. And finally, open relationships may sometimes mean a&nbsp;considerable emotional burden since you need to&nbsp;devote your attention to&nbsp;2&nbsp;partners.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think that, in&nbsp;the future, people will be&nbsp;more polygamous than now?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyspqadXaWysLzLnmShmaaaeq7By62gqaSVYr2ivtOnnKurXZbBbsDHnmSsmZ2aerW1zJ5kmpuTpL%2Bltc2gZK2nXaXAuq%2FHqKOon5mowbR5l2lrcm1lZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./acces-des-femmes-aux-plus-hautes-responsabilites-une-derniere-marche-gravir.html><span>←</span><span>une dernire marche gravir...</span></a>
