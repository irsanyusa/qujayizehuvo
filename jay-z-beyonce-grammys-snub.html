We love y’all, we love y’all. We want you to get it right—or at least get it close to right,” he said. “And obviously, it’s subjective … because it’s music and it’s opinion-based, but some things … I don’t want to embarrass this young lady but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn’t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won Album of the Year.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The camera then panned to Beyoncé. The singer is the most-nominated female artist in Grammys history, with 88 career nominations, and holds the most Grammy wins, with 32 awards. She has never won Album of the Year, despite being nominated in the category four times, losing previously to Taylor Swift, Beck, Adele, and Harry Styles. Out of the coveted Big Four categories—Best New Artist, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Album of the Year—Beyoncé has only won a Song of the Year Award, for “Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)" in 2010.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Beyoncé’s Album of the Year Snub Fits Into the Grammys’ Long History of Overlooking Black Women</a></p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The low-key disses continued. “Some of you are going to go home tonight and feel like you’ve been robbed,” Jay-Z said. “Some of you may get robbed, some of you don’t belong in the category”—a comment which earned gasps from the audience.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When I get nervous, I tell the truth,” he added.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the speech did end on a positive note from the rapper, culminating in a rapturous applause. “Just in life, you gotta keep showing up. Just keep showing up. Forget the Grammys. You gotta keep showing up, until they give you all those accolades you feel you deserve. Until they call you chairman. Until they call you a genius. Until they call you the greatest of all time.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After his speech, Jay-Z poured a drink into his Grammy trophy and took a sip from it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbmZlgnmFjqOYsmWqYq%2Bmxc6nmp5ll6eurrnYrGSspqWXfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pornography-why-christians-desperately-need-to-stop-watching-porn.html><span>←</span><span>Pornography Why Christians desperately need to stop watching porn</span></a>
