This time, they were joined by the wildcard Sea Queen. At the end of the episode, Hawk was unmasked as Teen Wolf star Tyler Posey.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wildcard-sea-queen-impresses-on-the-masked-singer>Wildcard Sea Queen Impresses on The Masked Singer</h2><p>During Tuesday’s show, Husky delivered an impressive performance of “Super Freak” by Rick James. They teased that they have a connection to Diddy. Nicole Scherzinger guessed that they could be Ginuwine. At the end of the night, Husky moved on thanks to the audience vote.</p><p>Wednesday’s episode also introduced us to a wildcard contestant called Sea Queen. They called themselves a “triple threat” before performing “Love Potion No. 9” by the Searchers. The panel was wowed by Sea Queen’s tone, with guesses including Erykah Badu and Jenifer Lewis.</p><p>Because it was Harry Potter night, this week’s contestants were also assigned a Hogwarts house by the Sorting Hat. Husky was assigned Hufflepuff, while Sea Queen was Slytherin. We’ll have to wait a little longer to find out who’s under those masks.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>WHAT’S THE REAL PRIZE OF WINNING ‘THE MASKED SINGER’? — HERE’S WHAT FANS THINK</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-was-voted-off-this-week>Who Was Voted Off This Week?</h3><p>At the end of the episode, Tiki and Hawk went head to head in a Smackdown. During the show, Tiki performed “Magic” by Pilot, earning a comparison to Freddie Mercury from Scherzinger. Ken Jeong thought Tiki might be Dave Grohl.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hawk performed “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic” by the Police. In his Smackdown against Tiki, both contestants performed “Monster” by Lady Gaga in their own style. Host Nick Cannon announced that Hawk was eliminated.</p><p>Before he was unmasked, the panel shared their guesses. They included Ryan Phillippe, Chad Michael Murray, Cole Sprouse, and Billie Joe Armstrong. None of them correctly guessed that it was Teen Wolf star Tyler Posey.</p><p>What did you think of Harry Potter night? Do you agree with the results?
