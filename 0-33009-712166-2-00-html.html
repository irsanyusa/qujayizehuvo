Earlier neolithic sculpture is totemic in nature, but Corsican menhirs, Grosjean noted, are "realistic and naturalistic, not stylized like Egyptian statues, and not divinities." To account for them, Grosjean has had to reconstruct an obscure artistic period. His starting point was a mysterious Mediterranean "People of the Sea," who left dome-shaped temples on Corsica, Sardinia and elsewhere in the Mediterranean. Identified as "Shardanes," they appear on an 1190 B.C. bas-relief in an Egyptian temple in Medinet Habu wearing horned helmets (the Corsican menhirs have helmets with holes that may have once been filled with horns). A likely conclusion: the Shardanes built the menhirs. Scratching the Surface. Elementary but wrong, decided Grosjean. Why would the Shardanes cut up their own monuments? Why would they sculpt menhirs on Corsica when they had not done so elsewhere? Grosjean hypothesized that he was dealing with a native Corsican people who had been at war with the Shardanes. The Shardanes had won, and hacked up the menhirs in retaliation. Grosjean suspects that the native Corsicans created replicas of their enemies, in hopes of capturing the invaders' magic. They may be the ancient people described by Aristotle, who "raised about their tombs as many obelisks as the dead man had killed enemies during his lifetime."</p><p>The prehistoric Corsicans evidently failed to stop the Shardanes, for many menhir fragments are embedded in the walls of Shardane temples. Still, they made gigantic strides in sculpture. Their earliest attempts (around 1800 B.C.) had simply a head separated from the body by a crude neck; their final works depict arms, hands, and what look like facial traits. Most remarkable of all, they were apparently laboriously carved with round, white quartz tools. Nor is their final reckoning complete; Grosjean discovered altogether 72 carved menhirs, of which 30 were finely sculpted. Says he: "I have only scratched the surface. There is enough digging here to keep ten full-time archaeologists busy for the next 200 years."</p><li><span class=title></span></li><li><a href=# class=prev>Previous Page</a></li><li><a href=# title=1 class=page>1</a></li><li><span class="page current">2</span></li><li><span class=next>Next Page</span></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6PBprrTZ6uipZVjsLC5jq2gpp1fqMKjv8KroJudomSus8DInKOeZ2BhgHR8j3JjcGliZoN3eZFlZ2lmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alice-in-wonderland-quiz.html><span>←</span><span>Quiz: Which Alice in Wonderland Character Are You?</span></a>
