Meghan Markle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/502/e57/67f43c5255aa14bf739e098359.jpg><p>Meghan <a href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about having a&nbsp;miscarriage in&nbsp;July when she felt a&nbsp;“sharp cramp” as&nbsp;she was changing her son Archie’s diaper. She knew that as&nbsp;she was clutching her firstborn child, she was losing her second. Through the pain of&nbsp;her loss, she learned that in&nbsp;a&nbsp;room of&nbsp;100&nbsp;women, 10&nbsp;to&nbsp;20&nbsp;of&nbsp;them will have suffered a&nbsp;miscarriage and realized that the only way to&nbsp;begin to&nbsp;heal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;first ask, “Are you okay?”</p><p><h2>2. Chrissy Teigen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f53/297/c7117258478050040e64a2a198.jpg><p>Chrissy wrote a&nbsp;heartbreaking <a href=#>essay</a> about saying goodbye to&nbsp;her son Jack and why she needed pictures to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken of&nbsp;the moment. She needed to&nbsp;know of&nbsp;the moment forever, the same way she needed to&nbsp;remember her kissing her husband at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the aisle. And she shared the story because she knew there were people who had lived this and could relate to&nbsp;her story.</p><p><h2>3. Beyoncé</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/979/8d3/33be0552a3a618f5b70e555982.jpg><p>Beyoncé spoke about having a&nbsp;miscarriage before becoming pregnant with Blue Ivy in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>documentary</a> and in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> with Oprah in&nbsp;2013. The reason she chose to&nbsp;share her story was because it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big part of&nbsp;her life and she knew there were many couples who had gone through the same experience. She admitted that it&nbsp;was the hardest thing she had ever been through.</p><p><h2>4. Céline Dion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e10/81a/57ef6e5bf4b96d3bf80c6b6f0b.jpg><p>Céline Dion <a href=#>endured</a> 6&nbsp;rounds of&nbsp;IVF and suffered a&nbsp;miscarriage before giving birth to&nbsp;her miracle twins. She said that she and her husband didn’t want to&nbsp;feel like they were playing yo-yo, being pregnant then not pregnant. But they didn’t give up&nbsp;and were able to&nbsp;provide their first son with siblings.</p><p><h2>5. Nicole Kidman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24d/925/e1f2e753a1b7a4034cb8bb1f6f.jpg><p>From the minute Tom Cruise and <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a> were married, she <a href=#>wanted</a> to&nbsp;have babies. But she lost a&nbsp;baby when she was 23&nbsp;and had a&nbsp;<a href=#>miscarriage</a> at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;her marriage with Tom Cruise. It&nbsp;was incredibly traumatic for her, and she shared her grief. Today, she has 2&nbsp;adopted children and 2&nbsp;children with Keith Urban, one of&nbsp;which was conceived through surrogacy.</p><p><h2>6. Pink</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/26e/b2f/8e9d3f546a8bc3e0d04894fe85.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the lyrics of&nbsp;her song, “Happy,” <a href=# title=Pink data-link=tag>Pink</a> <a href=#>wrote</a> not only about her body insecurity, but also about her first miscarriage that she experienced at&nbsp;age 17. Being young, she felt like her body hated her that her body was broken, and she didn’t think she did what she was supposed to&nbsp;do. She’s had several miscarriages since then and thinks it’s important to&nbsp;talk about what you’re ashamed&nbsp;of, who you really are, and the painful things.</p><p><h2>7. Whitney Houston</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fcb/750/8032b3593093a94b4d09b88c16.jpg><p>Whitney Houston <a href=#>confirmed</a> the rumor that she had a&nbsp;miscarriage during the filming of&nbsp;The Bodyguard. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with Barbara Walters in&nbsp;1993, she described that it&nbsp;was very painful, emotionally and physically. She was back on&nbsp;set the next day, and it&nbsp;was over. But she had Bobbi Kristina one year later, so&nbsp;she felt blessed.</p><p><h2>8. Christina Perri</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01b/5cb/59d8295ad9a21f7340bb6dfeef.jpg><p>Earlier this year, the “A&nbsp;Thousand Years” singer <a href=#>announced</a> that she had a&nbsp;miscarriage. She wrote that she hoped to&nbsp;help change the story and stigma around miscarriage by&nbsp;sharing her own harrowing experience. She added that she was so&nbsp;sad but not ashamed and sent a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;all the mothers who have been in&nbsp;the same place and who will be&nbsp;one day that she sees them and loves them.</p><p><h2>9. Gwyneth Paltrow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/743/99c/e8e6b551859bc581d22aa10e8c.jpg><p>The actress <a href=#>revealed</a> that she had a&nbsp;miscarriage when she was pregnant with her third child. Her children ask her to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;baby all the time. But she had a&nbsp;really bad experience when she was pregnant with her third because things didn’t work out and she nearly died. But the good thing&nbsp;is, she knows that she’s already the <a href=#>luckiest mom</a> ever with the 2&nbsp;kids she has.</p><p><h2>10. Gabrielle Union</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/405/b3d/ff243d56d5a7615304fe326479.jpg><p>The Bring It&nbsp;On&nbsp;actress <a href=#>shared</a> her experiences with infertility and miscarriages in&nbsp;her memoir. She wrote that she had 8&nbsp;or 9&nbsp;miscarriages. For 3&nbsp;years, she felt like her body had been a&nbsp;prisoner of&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;get pregnant. But just 2&nbsp;years back, she <a href=#>welcomed</a> a&nbsp;beautiful daughter born via surrogacy.</p><p><h2>11. Courteney Cox</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f1/a4d/ea6872532ca0370a2b44ab0bfc.jpg><p>Like her character Monica in&nbsp;Friends, Courteney Cox faced <a href=# title=fertility data-link=tag>fertility</a> issues. She had multiple miscarriages before giving birth to&nbsp;her daughter. She <a href=#>said</a> that she gets pregnant pretty easily but has a&nbsp;hard time keeping the baby. One of&nbsp;her miscarriages <a href=#>occurred</a> just before the character Rachel was giving birth in&nbsp;the sitcom, and she found it&nbsp;very challenging to&nbsp;do&nbsp;her job and make people laugh.</p><p><h2>12. Brooke Shields</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e72/ba9/d6dfb653f6aea0f94c9460433a.jpg><p>The actress found out that she was going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;<a href=#>miscarriage</a> right before she was set to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;stage for a&nbsp;performance with Kermit the Frog and she wrote about the experience in&nbsp;her memoir. She <a href=#>reflected</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that up&nbsp;until then, she thought simply because it&nbsp;was time and she wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;baby, it&nbsp;would work.</p><p><h2>13. Lindsay Lohan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb4/a55/74e4475a4fb907ab3f1531e10d.jpg><p>The Mean Girls actress broke the news of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;<a href=#>miscarriage</a> while filming her documentary series. She said that on&nbsp;the show when it&nbsp;was shown, she didn’t want to&nbsp;come down. She actually couldn’t move and was sick. It&nbsp;messed her up&nbsp;mentally.</p><p><h2>14. Halsey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff5/1f4/78f95357ed9a4fe6be64bc5cb2.jpg><p>The singer <a href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;Rolling Stone about getting pregnant on&nbsp;tour and later suffering a&nbsp;miscarriage. She beat herself up&nbsp;for&nbsp;it, even though she wasn’t sure what really caused the miscarriage. That’s because she thought the reason it&nbsp;happened was just because of&nbsp;the lifestyle she was living. She was overworked, anemic, and suffered from fainting spells. Her body just broke down.</p><p><h2>15. Mariah Carey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab6/c5f/8eb5fd510abe4a8589299baa97.jpg><p>Mariah Carey’s first <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> with Nick Cannon ended with a&nbsp;<a href=#>miscarriage</a>. They were ready to&nbsp;break the news to&nbsp;friends and family but they found out that she was no&nbsp;longer pregnant. It&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;shook them both and took them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place that was really dark and difficult. At&nbsp;that time, she wasn’t able to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;anybody about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>What we&nbsp;can take from their stories</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6da/ba5/cca6675bfaa434e1d08ee4d910.jpg><p>From these stories, we&nbsp;can see that miscarriages can happen to&nbsp;any woman through no&nbsp;fault of&nbsp;their own. Grieving parents can also take comfort in&nbsp;knowing that most miscarriages <a href=#>occur</a> because the fetus isn’t developing normally which can occur by&nbsp;chance, and not due to&nbsp;problems inherited by&nbsp;the parents. While it’s still a&nbsp;sad thing to&nbsp;happen to&nbsp;anyone, there is&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;have hope that future pregnancies will bring a&nbsp;child into the world.</p><p>Have you ever experienced a&nbsp;miscarriage yourself or&nbsp;know someone who has?
