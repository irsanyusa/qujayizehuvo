The star has also teased that she’s working on a new album — her first since the 2006 release Paris.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paris-hilton-releases-new-single-hot-one>Paris Hilton Releases New Single ‘Hot One’</h2><p>“Sage, they the shy one / Zane, the always high one / Tess is the lit one / Brett is the fit one / Oh shit, I forgot one!” Hilton sings to open the new track, which clocks in at under two minutes. “Me, I’m the hot one / Me, I’m the hot one.”</p><p>The track’s title is obviously a play on Hilton’s famous catchphrase, “That’s hot.” She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> that she’s “so proud” of the song, which she worked on with DJ Alex Chapman, who opened for her during her first concert in Los Angeles earlier this month.</p><p>“Seeing her in the recording studio in her tracksuit and sunglasses and performing the shit out of the song was so cool. She’s such a pro,” Chapman told the outlet. “It’s a new era of Paris and it’s going to be really great.”</p><p>Hilton teased the song in a Taco Bell commercial earlier this week, announcing the return of the Volcano Menu. This is her first solo single under the music division of her company 11:11 Media, as she says it “gives me full ownership of my music.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PARIS HILTON SAYS SHE WANTED TO ‘TELL MY TRUTH’ IN NEW MEMOIR</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hilton-is-working-on-a-new-album>Hilton Is Working on a New Album</h2><p>Hilton told Rolling Stone that “Hot One” was just one of a “bunch of tracks that were being submitted” for her new album. She previously revealed that she received over 200 songs from artists such as Miley Cyrus and Meghan Trainor.</p><p>“I was instantly inspired and knew we had to make this record,” Hilton shared. “We went into Sunset Sound Studio and ended up recording 3 songs in just one day! It was magic!”</p><p>Hilton’s music career kicked off in 2006, when she released “Stars Are Blind,” the lead single off her debut studio album Paris. She recently put out “Stars Are Blind (Paris’ Version),” featuring Kim Petras. Hilton previously performed the song with Sia and Miley Cyrus for New Year’s Eve.</p><p>What do you think of Hilton’s new single “Hot One”?
