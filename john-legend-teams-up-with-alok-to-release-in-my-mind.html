The techno tune is very lyrical, talking about yearning to be with someone. It has an easy to listen to groove</strong> <strong>and the possibility to hit the charts very quickly.</strong></p><p>This song begins with a light beat, accompanied by Legend’s equally as light vocals. Legend begins the song out in a lower register, and he sings the entire song with passion. His vocals are insane in this song.</p><p>This is an easy to listen to techno song, that has a fun island vibe to it. What I liked the most, was that the beat was there, but didn’t overpower Legend’s vocals. Alok did a great job at incorporating the electronic aspect of this song, without taking focus off of the vocals. Since this song is so lyrical, this well thought out balance is one of the best parts of the song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The lyrics of the song tell a story about Legend wanting to be with someone. The lyrics are well thought out, but also simple, so they’ll be easy for fans to remember.</p><p>The chorus of the tune is: “I just know I wanna be with you, I wanna be free, so if I close my eyes, I got you in my mind.”</p><p>Legend’s execution of this song has a very similar passion as “<a href=#>All of Me</a>.” Overall, it’s a very sweet, romantic techno tune.</p><p>Accompanying the release of this track, Legend also posted a piano edition of this song. In the <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram video</a>, he sits at a piano with two Grammys on top of it, and is seen wearing a jean jacket with roses on it.</p><p>Legend sings an uncut version of the new tune in the video. This video made it extremely evident that Legend’s voice is just as angelic without Alok’s accompaniment in this tune.</p><p>Fans in the comment section, discussed his voice, talent, and the new song with this raw video. I really liked how Alok was able to accentuate the angelic nature out of Legend’s voice in the studio version.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-new-song-and-a-new-puppy-pearl>A New Song, and A New Puppy, Pearl</h2><p>There are a lot of new things happening in Legend’s life right now. With <a href=#>The Voice premiere</a> on the horizon, a new single released today, and a new puppy, he’s been pretty busy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CR2SSsBIdbv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen welcomed their new dog, Pearl into the world in an <a href=#>Instagram post</a>. After the recent death of their <a href=#>french bulldog, Pippa</a>, they’ve added on to their family in welcoming in <a href=#>Pearl</a> the basset hound. Legend first shared photos of their <a href=#>new family member</a> on July 28, and they are absolutely adorable.</p><p>Teigan also <a href=# class=broken_link>shared that they</a> chose a basset hound as their new family member. She wanted to share the love of the dog breed with Legend and their kids since she grew up owning them.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1204327811.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Season 17 Winner Jake Hoot Stays Busy Ahead of Festival Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>john legend</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>New Music</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaifp2WcmrSmusNmq56Znah6tryMsKCtoF2WubC3jK2mZqqVobKiv8RmoKdlna56rrXNnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./honus-wagner.html><span>←</span><span>Honus Wagner (MLB Shortshop) - On This Day</span></a>
