The ladies spoke candidly about their life while being the popular brand’s Angels in&nbsp;their interview for the Real Pod podcast<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong> </strong></a>with a&nbsp;host Victoria Garrick.</p><p>Victoria asked the models if&nbsp;they influenced people who like to&nbsp;watch the fashion shows and how they felt about it&nbsp;afterwards.</p><p>Josephine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;weird time because you realize you were getting a&nbsp;massive amount of&nbsp;eyes looking at&nbsp;you. We&nbsp;got signed right when <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> exploded too, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was this combination of&nbsp;everyone’s gonna know you for this glamorous side, takes two and an&nbsp;hour, hours in&nbsp;hair and makeup, personal trainers, this whole situation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b5/d49/ad25645c3e98069f1c33830935.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;felt like it&nbsp;was overnight you just let people&nbsp;in, and&nbsp;I don’t think I&nbsp;understood, especially in&nbsp;the beginning, how obsessed people could be&nbsp;by&nbsp;the little details. Like they wanted to&nbsp;know what kind of&nbsp;toothpaste I&nbsp;used, and&nbsp;I was like, ’Really? That just seems boring,’” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> the model.</p><p>She added that it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;that moment she realized how much responsibility they had. Jasmine revealed that there’re a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;comments on&nbsp;her Instagram which say, “you’re always so&nbsp;put together,” and “you’re always so&nbsp;perfect”.</p><p>She says, “I’m like, no&nbsp;I’m not! Not even the slightest bit.”</p><p><h2>The glamorous image of&nbsp;the models and the real life are just two different things.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ad/b41/b8943758a5b5a9dd32aec7294b.jpg><p>Josephine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that, unlike many people, who wear their swimsuits to&nbsp;the beach or&nbsp;to&nbsp;the pool, for Victoria’s Secret models a&nbsp;bathing suit is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;uniform. She then added, “Nobody wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;their work suit twenty-four seven, none of&nbsp;us want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;glammed up&nbsp;twenty-four seven.”</p><p>She also said that the magazine cover look and the real life have nothing in&nbsp;common. The model added, “I&nbsp;would stand next to&nbsp;the big billboards on&nbsp;the street and&nbsp;I could stand there for 30&nbsp;minutes and not a&nbsp;single person could put the two people together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cad/57b/512bed5347919101882309abcc.jpg><p>“I’m like&nbsp;I don’t even look like my&nbsp;pictures. Sometimes my&nbsp;mom would be&nbsp;like, ’Is that you? I&nbsp;didn’t even know you could look like this,’” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> Josephine.</p><p>Commenting on&nbsp;the other peculiarities of&nbsp;her work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, the woman said, “Even though you were shooting underwear constantly, I&nbsp;never really felt naked because we&nbsp;had two layers of&nbsp;body makeup and sparkle and glitter and oil.”</p><p>The Angels would appear in&nbsp;their sweats before experiencing three hours of&nbsp;hair and makeup to&nbsp;make them look glamorous.</p><p><h2>The modelling sphere appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;even more demanding and exhausting than it&nbsp;may seem.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a5/39c/ede5205a5cb2fa4dc800675c64.jpg><p>Commenting on&nbsp;Victoria’s Secret being inclusive, Josephine revealed that the old epoch of&nbsp;the company was more inclusive in&nbsp;her opinion.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;was getting a&nbsp;little bit bigger than&nbsp;I was with a&nbsp;22-inch waist, and now&nbsp;I was 24, 25, and they were the first people to&nbsp;always say, ’Please do&nbsp;not lose weight.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b36/00a/d2a8cc5ded8e2d15b82253cc1a.jpg><p>22 inch waist?! o_0</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>, “So&nbsp;for&nbsp;us, that was extremely inclusive from the inside perspective compared to&nbsp;when&nbsp;I worked with high fashion who was the opposite. But we&nbsp;were obviously in&nbsp;this very small box that was the industry at&nbsp;the time, that was now looking back, not at&nbsp;all inclusive.”</p><p>And here’re the models, who raise awareness about the modelling industry with their unique appearance. These 11&nbsp;women redefine the <a href=#>beauty standards</a> and make a&nbsp;real stir in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fashion world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLK3sc1mpLJlnaS6brDInaWtZaKasLCzzaKxnmWdmnq3tcKtpquhkah6tLHCq5ytZZGjtKa40mapnq6VlrluwMeeZK2qpam1bq7EoaCnnF2ptaa10WaepZmdpL%2BwwdJmmpqsp5a5rHnIppignV1tfnWFj2lm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-seacrest.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Seacrest Archives - Talent Recap</span></a>
