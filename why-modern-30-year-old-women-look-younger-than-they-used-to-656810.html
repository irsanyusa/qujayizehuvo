It&nbsp;was easy to&nbsp;tell a&nbsp;20-year-old woman from a&nbsp;woman who was 10&nbsp;years older. But today, a&nbsp;young girl can really shock&nbsp;us with her passport that says “30&nbsp;years old” because today, 30-year-old girls look exactly the same as&nbsp;20-year-olds. Why is&nbsp;that?</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;find out more about the mysteries of&nbsp;age and want to&nbsp;understand why modern women look so&nbsp;different from the women of&nbsp;the past.</p><p><h2>They understand age differently.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cee/3f7/521fc756428174ad769768da6c.jpg><p>When today’s 30-year-old girls were growing&nbsp;up, they constantly heard that the age of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman’s beauty ended at&nbsp;30. It&nbsp;was the end of&nbsp;entertainment and happiness. But the stereotypes have changed and now we&nbsp;understand that 30&nbsp;years old is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great age! We&nbsp;don’t worry about these numbers anymore and we&nbsp;feel young which has a&nbsp;positive effect on&nbsp;our appearance.</p><p><h2>They have freedom of&nbsp;choice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4c/45b/63e2bc5cb4b78dc1c62dc91dc7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, when a&nbsp;woman was only 25&nbsp;years old, she got rid of&nbsp;bright clothes, short skirts, and other fun clothing because she thought that she was too old to&nbsp;wear them. Now, girls at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;30&nbsp;can still wear bright clothes, torn jeans, dye their hair in&nbsp;any color, have piercings and anything else they want. Such style helps them to&nbsp;look fresh and young.</p><p><h2>They have a&nbsp;more stable financial situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/074/420/94d7c3549da0c7c26d72005677.jpg><p>Modern 30-year-old women know a&nbsp;lot about <a href=# title=cosmetics data-link=tag>cosmetics</a> and skin care which has a&nbsp;positive impact on&nbsp;their appearance. More than that, at&nbsp;this age, they already have their own stable income, stores offer a&nbsp;wide array of&nbsp;choices, there are gyms everywhere, and confidence allows women to&nbsp;spend money on&nbsp;themselves. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, women have a&nbsp;habit of&nbsp;doing sports and taking good care of&nbsp;their appearance with money the previous generations didn’t have.</p><p><h2>They use the advanced cosmetology industry.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/581/64a/aee976505883a6563f15174fa3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, our mothers were not able to&nbsp;have cosmetic procedures done as&nbsp;easily. Today we&nbsp;can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;any age! There are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;cosmetologists everywhere, and the prices for these services are not that high. And we’re not only referring to&nbsp;plastic surgery: there are masks, massages, and other ways to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;yourself and your appearance.</p><p><h2>They’ve found their style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a1a/a63/cdf907531aa023ad4ca1997e7b.jpg><p>Shopping today is&nbsp;purely for pleasure. For those of&nbsp;us who love spending a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time shopping and walking around shops, there are huge malls. And for those who don’t, there are online stores with delivery services. A&nbsp;huge choice of&nbsp;products allows&nbsp;us to&nbsp;experiment and look for our style, to&nbsp;wear original clothes, and combine them in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting way. It’s hard to&nbsp;even imagine having clothes 40&nbsp;years ago when there wasn’t much to&nbsp;choose from.</p><p><h2>They have internal harmony and confidence.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f59/0f1/02c42955a9aa2e647297bc55e3.jpg><p>Social stereotypes have a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;women’s life goals and past generations could see only one goal: having a&nbsp;family. Few women dreamed of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;<a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. And there were far fewer opportunities for women in&nbsp;the past. Today, by&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;30, women already have an&nbsp;<a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a>, a&nbsp;career, and more goals to&nbsp;reach in&nbsp;their lives than they used&nbsp;to. And all their self-confidence makes them more attractive.</p><p><h2>They are more responsible about their health.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a07/de9/d2f5f2530fa89b4c89172b7421.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, medicine used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;harder to&nbsp;get access&nbsp;to. Today, it’s really easy to&nbsp;see any doctor on&nbsp;any convenient day&nbsp;— there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;private clinics that provide high-quality medical treatment.</p><p><h2>They respect themselves and can stand their ground.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/849/3c5/2123585bbea5d5283207158087.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, society used to&nbsp;tell women that it&nbsp;was necessary to&nbsp;respect all other people’s opinions, especially if&nbsp;they were older. So, if&nbsp;anyone who was older than you told you something, you’d likely be&nbsp;ashamed and your self-confidence would be&nbsp;shaken. Today, these social stereotypes are changing, and we&nbsp;know that not all older people are necessarily smarter than&nbsp;us. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;take their opinions more critically. We&nbsp;respect ourselves, our opinions, and our <a href=#>bodies</a> more. This kind of&nbsp;attitude does wonders for our appearance.</p><p><h2>They know how important it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;drink enough water.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39f/ea0/32c2975366ab69cd52e95cf652.jpg><p>For people of&nbsp;all ages, it’s really important to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>drink enough water</a>&nbsp;— the skin becomes more hydrated and the body gains enough fluids.</p><p>Every age has its own advantages, so&nbsp;you shouldn’t worry about the numbers on&nbsp;your ID. What advantages does your current age have?
