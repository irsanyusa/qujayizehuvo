“Chivas saw here in America, where they had not been on television for the past year, that it could provide an opportunity for fans to have a couple of hours of enjoyment of football and a few moments to just think about other things than the difficult times that we’re all going through,” said Tag Garson, a New York-based senior vice president at Wasserman Media Group who represented Chivas in talks with the networks."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Fox Deportes, which regularly broadcasts Monterrey’s home matches, pulled together a 30-minute pregame show prior to the match’s 11 p.m. ET kickoff, which featured Los Angeles Galaxy star Javier “Chicharito” Hernández discussing his love for Chivas, whom he played for from 2006-10.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Across the three Spanish-language cable networks, each of which added its own commentary and graphics, the match delivered a combined average audience of 598,000 total viewers. (FuboTV and CBS Sports, which streamed the game in English on CBSSports.com and the CBS Sports app, both declined to share viewership figures.)</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Saturday night Liga MX matches that air on Univision’s flagship broadcast network routinely deliver high six- and low seven-figure audiences, but the 415,000 who tuned in for Chivas-Monterrey on TUDN was the cable network’s second-best audience for a Liga MX telecast in 2020.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The match was played behind closed doors, and Liga MX has since suspended its own schedule.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5i1qsLArGSsoZ2quaSt0q1krJ2VoLavs4yrnK2toqN6tr%2BMrZylnaaewKq7zQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-circulaire-precise-la-mise-en-oeuvre-des-residences-hotelieres-vocation-sociale.html><span>←</span><span>Une circulaire prcise la mise en oeuvre des rsidences htelires vocation sociale</span></a>
