The Stitcher apps and web-streaming audio service will be shutting down on Aug. 29, 2023, according to a notice posted to its site Tuesday.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>“Stitcher Farewell” notice</a>, the service explains it this way: “<a href=# id=auto-tag_siriusxm data-tag=siriusxm>SiriusXM</a>, the owner of Stitcher, is focused on incorporating podcasts into its flagship SiriusXM subscription business. Subscribers can listen to podcasts within the SiriusXM app and will see an all-new listening experience later this year.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Stitcher name isn’t totally disappearing, though: The company said it “expect[s] to continue to operate our Stitcher Studios and Earwolf networks” that produce original podcast shows.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In most cases, according to SiriusXM, podcast fans will still be able to listen to ad-supported versions of shows that have been on Stitcher on other platforms.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Stitcher Premium service, which cost $4.95/month (or $34.99/year) and provided thousands of podcasts to listen to without ads, also is being discontinued. Hosts and creators of podcast exclusively on Stitcher Premium “will determine availability and accessibility of their shows,” the company’s website says. “To stay updated on the availability of their content, we recommend following the hosts/creators on social media or subscribing to their newsletters.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a memo to SiriusXM staff Tuesday from Joe Inzerillo, chief product and technology officer, John Trimble, chief ad revenue officer, and Scott Greenstein, chief content officer, the trio said the strategic reason for the Stitcher shutdown is to incorporate podcasts “more holistically into our flagship SiriusXM subscription service.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Podcasts are an important part of both our subscription and advertising strategies,” they wrote. “The scale and reach of our widely distributed podcasts has been and remains a crucial accelerant for our advertising sales business, while incorporating podcasts more holistically into our flagship SiriusXM subscription service will help to drive further growth. As a result, we have made the decision to sunset our standalone podcast listening app as we increase our focus on these priorities.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The execs also wrote that the Stitcher team is “now fully integrated into SiriusXM.” In addition, they said, “On the content side, through our reorganization earlier this year, which moved podcast programming alongside comedy and entertainment, we are able to give legendary podcasters a new platform on SiriusXM while also introducing the biggest stars on our roster to podcasting.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">There will not be layoffs associated with the shutdown of the Stitcher app, according to sources familiar with the company. In March, <a href=#>SiriusXM announced it was eliminating 475 jobs</a>, representing about 8% of its headcount. CEO Jennifer Witz&nbsp;cited economic uncertainty and a need to operate with “greater agility and efficiency” for the layoffs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Stitcher first bowed its podcast app in 2008, and the company has changed hands several times since then. <a href=#>SiriusXM acquired Stitcher in 2020</a> in a deal worth up to $325 million from E.W. Scripps (whose Midroll Media unit bought Stitcher for $4.5 million four years earlier).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As of Tuesday (June 27), SiriusXM said it will turn off automatic renewals of all Stitcher Premium subscription plans. Where applicable, refunds will be issued to Stitcher Premium subscribers who purchased a plan directly from Stitcher via the original payment method. Those who purchased access on the Stitcher app through the Apple or Google app stores will receive a refund from their respective billing platform. “Refunds are expected to begin to be processed on August 29th,” the Stitcher shutdown notice says, adding that customers should allow up to 60 days to receive refunds.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The SiriusXM Podcast Network remains unchanged. The audio content and advertising division comprises Stitcher Studios (with shows including “Let’s Talk Off Camera with Kelly Ripa,” “Sounds Gay,” “Sound Detectives” and an upcoming LeVar Burton children’s series); Team Coco (“Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend,” “Significant Others”); Earwolf (“How Did This Get Made?”); and SXM Podcasts (which has <a href=#>an overall deal with Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat for radio and podcasts</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2Fjp2goKGklrlwusSwqmirpJ7BpLTEq2SsoKWpwaq6xmabqK%2BeYsCqvsiuqrGlXaW8pa%2FArKtmmaClenJ%2Bkm5tbm1pboFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shark-attack-survival-tips.html><span>←</span><span>Shark Attack Survival Tips: What to Do If Bitten by Shark</span></a>
