Crying is usually accompanied with songs known as "crying marriage songs".</p><p>This crying custom was so important years ago that if the bride-to-be does not cry, her neighbors would see her as lacking home training. There are situations where she could be beaten by her mother for not crying at the wedding ceremony.</p><p>The bride's intelligence and virtue are also judged based on how well she can sing the crying marriage songs. Also, her crying or absence of it, is used to judge her identity and reputation. In some places, it is used as a symbol of the bride's wisdom and morals.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7912c113-8147-4bd0-8581-e5db34a7804f data-caption="Chinese weddings"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/J9NktkpTURBXy8wMjYyZTBjODEzOWE3YmFiZGNlYTMwMDhmMjg3MDNlMi5wbmeRlQLNArDNAb3Cww></span><p>There are situations where young girls of 15 and 16 are trained to cry in a bid to prepare them for their wedding.
