The announcement, last month, of Joe Rogan’s live Netflix special felt strangely inevitable. Airing on Aug. 3 at 10pm ET, Joe Rogan: Burn Your Boats will be the first stand-up special in six years from the comedian who is now best known for his rambling interview podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. Massively popular, chronically controversial, and adored by a huge audience that has remained loyal even as he drew criticism for spreading COVID-19 misinformation and using racial slurs, Rogan is just the kind of voice Netflix loves to elevate.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>PDF</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>

"Things are a lot better now compared to how it was when I started acting. There’s Netflix, DSTV, Showmax, and many more. They are making things better.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Childrens Drawings of What Earth Will Look Like in 30Years</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>
