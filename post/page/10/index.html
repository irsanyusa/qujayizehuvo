Precisely for that reason, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not uncommon to&nbsp;feel the blush rise to&nbsp;our cheeks and white smoke come out of&nbsp;our ears every time one of&nbsp;our beloved children comes up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;witty comeback. We&nbsp;continue walking while we&nbsp;draw a&nbsp;nervous smile on&nbsp;our face, trying to&nbsp;hide the embarrassment of&nbsp;the situation.
At&nbsp;Bright Side, we&nbsp;are fans of&nbsp;children’s witticisms, which show&nbsp;us that naivety is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;wonderful thing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to stay safe during a protest</h2><time>Sep 4, 2024</time>
