Earlier this week I took a pre-opening tour of the new Greek and Roman Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum. (All praise to my cheerful guide Chris Lightfoot, a Met curator of Roman art. When we talk about “digging” in my business, we don’t mean anything as literal as what he does in Turkey.) Just like the Getty Villa in Malibu, which re-opened last year just as the storm over the antiquities trade was hitting home, the Met galleries are debuting when there are still a lot of claims from Greece and Italy on ancient works in U.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Trevor Brooking popularity &amp;amp; fame</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>

Do you prefer your Phillips with one or two Ls, or your Anns with an e?With the ONS revealing the most popular baby names of the year so far, it has become clear that parents are favouring more unusual spellings of names. For instance, the first name Jaxon has overtaken the more traditional spelling of Jackson for the first time.
While new parents might increasingly be fans of this spelling, a new YouGov Omnibus survey reveals that only 4% of Britons like Jaxon over Jackson.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>&amp;quot;There could be no honor...&amp;quot; - Ann Landers</h2><time>Sep 14, 2024</time>
<a href=../../wisdom-bank-there-could-be-no-honor-ann-landers.html></a>
Ann Landers was a pen name created by Chicago Sun-Times advice columnist Ruth Crowley in 1943 and taken over by Esther Pauline "Eppie" Lederer in 1955. For 56 years, the Ask Ann Landers syndicated advice column was a regular feature in many newspapers across North America. ADVERTISEMENT
Due to this popularity, "Ann Landers," though fictional, became something of a national institution and cultural icon. ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mirnpuYZMSqv8OopGaakaO4bsDHnqmeZZOkwq2wjJucZqafYrWwus6rZJqmnmK5orrDnqmsZ6GchqXG0K0%3D</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Boris Johnson popularity &amp;amp; fame</h2><time>Sep 14, 2024</time>

Historical Context Mary Stuart was Queen of Scots from 1547 until she was deposed in 1567. She spent the next twenty years of her life in exile or imprisoned. After she was deposed, she sought the assistance of her first cousin once removed, Elizabeth I, who reigned over England.
This complicated matters however as Elizabeth perceived Mary as a threat and had her imprisoned while a commission of inquiry investigated whether she was responsible for the death of her first husband, which had been the proximate cause of her overthrow.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Money Does Joshua Malina Make?
