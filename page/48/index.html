<a href=../../assassination-of-julius-caesar.html></a>
Historical Context By the time of his assassination on 15 March (the Ides of March) 44BC, Julius Caesar was at the height of his power, having recently been declared dictator perpetuo by the Roman Senate.
This kind of power made many senators nervous that Caesar would overthrow the senate and establish one-man tyranny. Thus they planned to murder him and restore the authority of the Roman Republic.
Despite being warned of the plot in the days before, Caesar went to the Senate on the 15th.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Contacts et actualits en Provence-Alpes-Cte-dAzur</h2><time>Jul 17, 2024</time>

The ceremony which has been tagged the 'burial of the year' has seen many socialites, business icons, politicians, top government functionaries and politicians gather at Oba in Anambra state to support the businessman. Obi Cubana personally received Davido at the newly constructed Awka airport on Friday, July 16, 2021. ADVERTISEMENT

In an interview with Business Insider on Wednesday, Moskovitz described the upsides of working in enterprise tech, rather than consumer tech. Moskovitz has been the CEO of Asana — “I do think it’s nice to have a straightforward business model where you create something valuable for companies and they pay you for it," Moskovitz told us.

But these goldfish are also swimming in salt  250 mg per serving. Better choice: Honey Maid graham crackers. Put the goldfish aside for another classic kids favorite. Graham crackers are much lower in salt.

Tuesday the internet erupted in a wave of Sochi shock that had nothing to do with dangerous half pipes, packs of wild dogs, or atrocious hotel accommodations.
Can you believe that Olympic athletes are all using Tinder—a DATING APP—at the Olympic village? So much so that “Tinder hook-ups [are] off the hook”? This is completely unexpected. Why would the world’s best athletes, in their physical prime, with endorphins to kill and calories to burn, and who are all compressed in a small living space be so interested in this particular extracurricular activity?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Thailand Lawmakers Pass Historic Marriage Equality Bill</h2><time>Jul 17, 2024</time>
