And we&nbsp;can never thank moms enough for the support and dedication they’ve been showing to&nbsp;their kids. Unfortunately, some might get caught up&nbsp;in&nbsp;adulthood responsibilities and tend to&nbsp;forget to&nbsp;spend time with their mothers. We&nbsp;surely don’t need reasons to&nbsp;hang out with them, but it&nbsp;turned out that there are actual reasons why we&nbsp;should, and who would have thought about the last one on&nbsp;this list?</p><p>We&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side</strong> have done some <a href=# title=research data-link=tag>research</a> on&nbsp;the reasons why we&nbsp;should spend time with our moms, so&nbsp;keep scrolling to&nbsp;find out more about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>1. A&nbsp;great relationship with your mother could help keep her mind sharper for a&nbsp;longer time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4d/51c/677d4b55e0b06e4bf2a7f642f8.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>research</a> published in&nbsp;the <i>Journal of&nbsp;Alzheimer’s Disease</i>, spending time with our parents might help decrease the risk of&nbsp;developing dementia, which affects their thinking, memory, reasoning, and personality.</p><p>The personal relationship with our mothers can have a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;their cognitive abilities as&nbsp;they age. Inviting them for dinner or&nbsp;spending holidays together would only make them feel appreciated and desired. That way, they’ll probably keep their minds sharper for a&nbsp;longer time.</p><p><h2>2. You can create memories for a&nbsp;lifetime.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b07/5bb/90476557f58b8a056ab2ace4d6.jpg><p>Our moms have been with&nbsp;us through every stage of&nbsp;our life; they witnessed our first step, our first day at&nbsp;school, our first date, and even our first paycheck. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;memories were made for these people who have been <a href=# title=lucky data-link=tag>lucky</a> enough to&nbsp;have their moms beside them.</p><p>Today, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;hate to&nbsp;admit&nbsp;it, we&nbsp;are aware that moms can age too. They’ll be&nbsp;less active, vibrant, and full of&nbsp;life than they were decades ago, but recalling the great time spent together would put a&nbsp;huge smile on&nbsp;our faces. Feel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grateful</a> for the beautiful time spent together and happy for the lifetime of&nbsp;memories.</p><p><h2>3. She will teach you lessons and skills you wouldn’t ever learn in&nbsp;school or&nbsp;from friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3fd/cfe/406e9c5b62b4992f4b5e88baab.jpg><p>Your mom is&nbsp;the most significant source of&nbsp;guidance in&nbsp;this world. She knew things way before you did and was able to&nbsp;distinguish right from wrong. Mothers can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a> of&nbsp;inspiration too, as&nbsp;they teach their children to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fearless and have confidence in&nbsp;themselves.</p><p>Your relationship with your mom was the first relationship you ever had. From day one, she was able to&nbsp;help you deal with the outside world, to&nbsp;grow, and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fulfilled. It&nbsp;was their advice, support, and lessons that made&nbsp;us the men and women we&nbsp;are today. And lessons never stop&nbsp;— even in&nbsp;your forties and fifties, you’ll realize that your mom knows better and you’ll always ask for her advice.</p><p><h2>4. She fulfills the need to&nbsp;feel loved and accepted.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d46/8cf/61adfc5fdfb07a23ec5637fe46.jpg><p>No&nbsp;one in&nbsp;this world will love you as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;your mother. Friends might come and&nbsp;go, spouses and partners as&nbsp;well, but the mother-child bond is&nbsp;unbreakable. And this specific kind of&nbsp;love soothes our hearts. Furthermore, with love comes acceptance and true appreciation, they accept their children and love them for who they truly are.</p><p>It’s been proven that human beings <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>need</a> to&nbsp;feel loved and<strong> </strong>accepted by&nbsp;others, just for being themselves. By&nbsp;all means, our mothers are the only people capable of&nbsp;granting&nbsp;us this feeling of&nbsp;being loved and accepted because we&nbsp;never fear their judgment. Sharing a&nbsp;look, a&nbsp;touch, a&nbsp;hug, or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;kiss from them is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;make&nbsp;us feel accepted and deeply loved.</p><p><h2>5. Spending time with your mom might extend her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac4/ede/92f1675a3ea9357d903460a4ee.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you want your mom to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;long, healthy life, you’d better start making plans with her! According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a>, which was conducted by&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;California and lasted for 6&nbsp;years, the lack of&nbsp;social connection later in&nbsp;life can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;deterrent to&nbsp;one’s health.</p><p>In&nbsp;other words, the study revealed that elderly people who felt lonely and left out suffered from health problems, such as&nbsp;worsening disabilities. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;that, it&nbsp;also showed that the association between loneliness in&nbsp;old age and lifespan was significant. This makes&nbsp;us understand that spending as&nbsp;much time as&nbsp;possible with our moms might extend their lives and make them happier.</p><p>How’s your relationship with your mother? Do&nbsp;you spend time with her? We’d love to&nbsp;know more about it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the comments!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIJuvsSaqqimo2LEqcWMsqauZZ6asqV506hkoZmenHqwwdNmrqKsmGLGsMHRZqSopV2ivLOxjHFnb29gZ3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-we-love-snow.html><span>←</span><span>Why People Love Snow So Much</span></a>
