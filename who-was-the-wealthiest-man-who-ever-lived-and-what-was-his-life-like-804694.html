It&nbsp;also covered parts of&nbsp;what are now Senegal, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and the Ivory Coast.</p><p>It&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>largest</a> empires in&nbsp;West Africa, and its language and laws have influenced the current culture within the region.</p><p><h2>Mansa Musa’s riches came from the region’s natural resources, which were gold and salt.</h2></p><p>Back in&nbsp;the 14th century, the Mali Empire accounted for almost half of&nbsp;the world’s old <a href=# title=gold data-link=tag>gold</a>. And every piece of&nbsp;it&nbsp;belonged to&nbsp;Mansa Musa.</p><p>As&nbsp;one specialist <a href=#>explained</a>, the kingdom’s ruler had unlimited access to&nbsp;the world’s most valued resource at&nbsp;that time.</p><p>Trading centers for other goods were also located within Mansa Musa’s territory, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;acquired wealth from those businesses as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>His net worth is&nbsp;estimated at&nbsp;$400&nbsp;billion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/197/07e/93dfb655b49b79f1f3a79d6319.jpg><p>While net worth constantly fluctuates, both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bezos</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Musk</a> have registered values that reached the $200-billion mark.</p><p>They are still about hundreds of&nbsp;billions behind the inflation-adjusted, $400 billion figure that experts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>computed</a> for Mansa Musa. This wealthy ruler would have probably given the fictional Wakanda a&nbsp;run for his money too.</p><p>One professor told BBC in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> that “contemporary accounts of&nbsp;Musa’s wealth are so&nbsp;breathless that it’s almost impossible to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;just how wealthy and powerful he&nbsp;truly was.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;traveled lavishly and brought an&nbsp;entire detail with him on&nbsp;his pilgrimage to&nbsp;Mecca.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae1/ab7/8d74d750c4bad3404d1a7f35d2.jpg><p>When Mansa Musa embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pilgrimage in&nbsp;1324, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reportedly</a> brought 60,000 men with him.</p><p>His travel detail included all of&nbsp;his royal officials, soldiers, merchants, slaves, some goats and sheep for food, and about a&nbsp;hundred camels that each carried loads of&nbsp;gold.</p><p>And they also traveled in&nbsp;style, as&nbsp;most of&nbsp;them were allegedly clad in&nbsp;gold and fine Persian silk.</p><p><h2>Mansa Musa was quite the philanthropist too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce9/c33/12dd675900988f3156db23317f.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;historical accounts, Mansa Musa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> gold to&nbsp;the poor people he&nbsp;met along his journey, and also traded gold for souvenirs when he&nbsp;passed through Cairo and Medina.</p><p>Ancient historian Al-Umari <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> about his conversation with an&nbsp;emir from Cairo, who met Mansa Musa. He&nbsp;said the African king spoke through an&nbsp;interpreter, even if&nbsp;he&nbsp;himself was fluent in&nbsp;Arabic. And he&nbsp;also gave the treasury lots of&nbsp;native gold and other valuables.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;gave away so&nbsp;much gold in&nbsp;Cairo that it&nbsp;caused an&nbsp;economic crisis.</h2></p><p>According to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>emir</a>, Mansa Musa “flooded” Cairo with his riches. The surplus of&nbsp;gold caused its value to&nbsp;drop, and that resulted in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>economic</a> losses to&nbsp;the tune of&nbsp;around $1.5 billion all over the Middle East.</p><p>“He&nbsp;gave out so&nbsp;much Malian gold along the way that jelis [griots] don’t like to&nbsp;praise him in&nbsp;their songs because they think he&nbsp;wasted local resources outside the empire,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> one academic.</p><p><h2>The African King was so&nbsp;powerful that, during his trip, he&nbsp;also acquired territories.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;appears simple travel souvenirs just didn’t cut it&nbsp;for Mansa Musa. He&nbsp;also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took</a> the territory of&nbsp;Gao within the Songhai kingdom and expanded the empire to&nbsp;the southern end of&nbsp;the Sahara Desert.</p><p>On&nbsp;the upside, he&nbsp;also used his immense wealth for the greater good. During his reign, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commissioned</a> universities, libraries, and other structures across the kingdom. Some of&nbsp;these ancient buildings are still standing today.</p><p><h2>Mansa Musa put himself and his empire on&nbsp;the map. Literally.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Catalan Atlas</a> map from the year 1375, on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;Timbuktu (which became part of&nbsp;the Mali Empire), there was a&nbsp;drawing of&nbsp;an&nbsp;African King who was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>depicted</a> sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;throne and holding a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;precious metal in&nbsp;his hand.</p><p>During the 19th century, Timbuktu gained the mythical status as&nbsp;the “Lost City of&nbsp;Gold” and became a&nbsp;popular destination for treasure hunters and explorers.</p><p><h2>The Mali Empire crumbled after Mansa Musa’s passing.</h2></p><p>The opulent ruler is&nbsp;<a href=#>credited</a> with starting the tradition of&nbsp;education in&nbsp;West Africa. But if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;rich and revered, why haven’t we&nbsp;heard of&nbsp;him?</p><p>After Mansa Musa died, sometime around the 1330s, his sons inherited the throne. Sadly, they were not able to&nbsp;hold the empire together and the smaller states broke off one by&nbsp;one.</p><p>When the Europeans arrived in&nbsp;the region, the kingdom finally ended. And according to&nbsp;one expert, “The history of&nbsp;the medieval period is&nbsp;still largely seen only as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Western history,” which is&nbsp;why Mansa Musa’s story was relatively unknown.</p><p>If&nbsp;Mansa Musa were alive, what one question would you like to&nbsp;ask him? And if&nbsp;you had billions at&nbsp;your disposal, how or&nbsp;where would you spend&nbsp;it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpu4ywmKxlpJ2ybsPEmqOtoJmawLV5zJqlZq%2BYpHqmwsSrZKWhppqxbq3NnWSwoJGperit0mafoqtdobansYyloKSdXW19dYKYbWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ray-charles.html><span>←</span><span>Ray Charles (Musician) - On This Day</span></a>
