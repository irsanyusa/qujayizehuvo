On closer look, an Italian musician in 20007 claimed to have found musical notes in the painting. These notes are hidden in the bread rolls and hands of the apostles and when played, results in a tuneful 40-second musical composition.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c0e392b8-3ea1-47e7-8a20-1a88e4d76077 data-caption="The Last Supper"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/xotktkpTURBXy9hOTI2NDRkMjg0NGQxNjEyMmRmMjdkZmEzYTU0MDgwMC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAYnCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>3) Bill Clinton’s portrait by Nelson Shanks</strong></p><p>In 2006, an American artist John Nelson Shanks made a portrait of former U.S President Bill Clinton. At first glance, this painting is just a portrait of the former president standing beside a mantel in the Oval Office.</p><p>The artist however included in this painting a shadow from a lady’s dress - the same stained blue dress of Monica Lewinsky that became a symbol of the Clinton’s scandal during the 1990's.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-93b6fb95-13be-4f68-9e3d-739547ce44e1 data-caption="Bill Clinton"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3J0ktkpTURBXy8yMGVkNzA5ZGZhYmZjNDBkZDQ1ZDNjZTFiOTRhZmU4YS5wbmeRlQLNAZPNAvnCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>4) The Madonna with Saint Giovannino by Domenico Ghirlandaio</h3></p><p>The Madonna with Saint Giovannino, is another painting that has something ‘unusual’. Painted in the 15th century by Italian Renaissance artist Domenico Ghirlandaio, this painting shows Mary from the Bible praying over baby Jesus.</p><p>On closer look, there is a distinctly recognizable shape of a UFO, with a man in the background shielding his eyes to gaze up at it. It is said that at the time this painting was done, this little addition was based on the belief that alien life exists.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6d88ccef-31cc-486b-a735-764c74339dbd data-caption="The Madonna "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/BTDktkpTURBXy81Zjk5ZTc5Y2U0NmY0YWE0MmFlOTljY2E3M2MwOTBmOC5wbmeRlQLNAr3NAbbCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>5) Mona Lisa - Da Vinci</h3></p><p>The popular da Vinci’s Mona Lisa which depicts a smiling La Gioconda at the Louvre in Paris has also had its own share of controversies especially with all the hidden messages and clues in it.</p><p>Some of them include the artist’s initials “LV” in her right eye, the number 72 marked in the arch of the bridge, theories that she was pregnant at the time of the painting and even another painting was discovered lurking beneath the surface of this popular piece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cIGMn5imp6WoerGtyKeroqaXqHq1tMCtZKGZppp6qbXDnZynZZ2arq%2B1zaCqaGphbn65tsM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-residence-intergenerationnelle-une-piste-plus-prometteuse-que-la-cohabitation.html><span>←</span><span>une piste plus prometteuse que la cohabitation ?</span></a>
