June’s 22-year-old daughter Lauryn Shannon (aka Pumpkin) has won full custody of her 16-year-old sister.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mama-june-loses-custody-of-honey-boo-boo>Mama June Loses Custody of Honey Boo Boo</h2><p>According to <a href=#>The Sun</a>, court documents show that a judge awarded Lauryn sole custody of Alana, saying it’s “in the best interest of the child.” Lauryn has had guardianship of Alana since 2019.</p><p>Reports state that June will pay $800 per month in child support. Lauryn will decide when Alana and June will have visitation. Both parties apparently agreed to the arrangement, according to the ruling.</p><p>In recent years, June has struggled with addiction. In 2019, she was arrested for drug possession and later entered rehab. She claims to now be two years sober and recently confirmed that she married her boyfriend Justin Shroud earlier this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lauryn and her husband, Josh Efird, already have four kids of their own together. Their children include newborn twins, as well as a 4-year-old daughter and a 10-month-old son.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>HONEY BOO BOO, MAMA JUNE TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mother-and-daughter-appeared-on-the-masked-singer>Mother and Daughter Appeared on ‘The Masked Singer’</h3><p>During Season 6 of <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>, June and Alana appeared together as Beach Ball.
