By comparison, perceptions of Cuomo went unchanged in the aftermath of state Attorney General Letitia James’ <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Jan. 28 report</a> that first revealed the undercounting of nursing home deaths.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Each poll has a 2-point margin of error.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Cuomo is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>still more popular</a> than he was before the pandemic began. But the past 10 days have brought the governor his worst numbers since April, when he and a number of other state chief executives saw surges in popularity as they took active roles in tackling the virus. For Cuomo, the nursing home story may be snowballing into something more as he faces public allegations of political bullying from officials in his own party.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Cuomo – who has said he will seek a fourth term next year – retains the support of more than 4 in 5 Democratic voters in his state, but his grip on the base has softened since late last month. Thirty-three percent of New York Democrats in the latest polling “strongly” approve of Cuomo’s job performance, down 9 points from responses gathered Jan. 19-28, and nearly half “somewhat” approve.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Additionally, Cuomo’s approval among independents has fallen underwater for the first time since the start of the pandemic: According to the latest surveys, 42 percent of independent voters approve of Cuomo and 49 percent disapprove.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5jCsLnOZpipqKKkw6K4jKuYraGenHqvsdZmsKiqm2K7tr7SoqWgZZikuqZ5w56YraCj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./biden-american-families-plan-support-poll.html><span>←</span><span>Bidens $1.8 Trillion American Families Plan Is Supported by Nearly 60% of Voters</span></a>
