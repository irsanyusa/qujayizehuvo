These caves were discovered by&nbsp;the Maori community ancestors, and it’s proof of&nbsp;nature’s print. Visitors can see, from a&nbsp;boat, thousands of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>glowworms </a>that put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;show every time someone enters the grotto. These lights are contrasted by&nbsp;the unique cave formations.</p><p><h2>2. White Sands National Park, New Mexico, USA</h2></p><p>This national park is&nbsp;in&nbsp;New Mexico, USA, and the weather patterns of&nbsp;this place preserve these immense fields of&nbsp;gypsum sand. The park is&nbsp;about 275 square miles long and holds these wave-like dune fields that are home to&nbsp;plants and animals that have adapted to&nbsp;this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>environment</a>.</p><p><h2>3. Wulingyuan, Hunan, China</h2></p><p>This eye-catching <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>landscape </a>is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;the Hunan province in&nbsp;<a href=# title=China data-link=tag>China</a>. With more than 26,000 hectares of&nbsp;territory, this scenery is&nbsp;known for its 3,000 narrow sandstone pillars and peaks, some over 200 meters high. Streams, pools, and waterfalls run through these rocks. People like to&nbsp;get lost in&nbsp;their caves and feel the adrenaline when crossing its natural bridges.</p><p><h2>4. Pamukkale, Turkey</h2></p><p>Pamukkale can be&nbsp;translated to&nbsp;“cotton castle,” and it’s is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very appropriate name for this distinctive landscape. Over the years, flowing water has left a&nbsp;carbonate mineral that has formed white pools that are known around the world. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that these <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>waters </a>have healing powers and people around the world travel to&nbsp;verify if&nbsp;that’s true.</p><p><h2>5.

This bridge is&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;“The Devil’s Bridge” and it&nbsp;was built during the Middle Ages completely by&nbsp;the people who lived near the bridge. And because it’s difficult to&nbsp;reach&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;has become a&nbsp;myth on&nbsp;its own.</p><p><h2>6. Marble Caves, Patagonia, Chile</h2></p><p>This landscape looks as&nbsp;if&nbsp;was hand-painted by&nbsp;some artist many years ago, but it&nbsp;was actually created by&nbsp;nature itself. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>formation </a>of&nbsp;these caves goes back 6,000&nbsp;years, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;ever-changing. The amazing shapes were formed by&nbsp;aggressive waves that have formed these structures that resemble marble, which is&nbsp;why they bear the name.</p><p><h2>7. Salar de&nbsp;Uyuni, Bolivia</h2></p><p>The Salar de&nbsp;Uyuni, located in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bolivia</a>, is&nbsp;the world’s largest salt flat, covering over 4,050 square miles of&nbsp;the Altiplano. This extended field is&nbsp;filled to&nbsp;the horizon with polygonal patterns that rose from the ground. At&nbsp;certain times of&nbsp;the year, lakes located near the Salar overflow and cover it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;water that creates a&nbsp;mirror-like illusion that serves as&nbsp;the perfect backdrop for a&nbsp;photo shoot.</p><p><h2>8. Chocolate Hills, Bohol, Philippines</h2></p><p>The Island of&nbsp;Bohol holds in&nbsp;its territory these geological <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>formations </a>that are unique in&nbsp;the world, with more than 1,268 cone-shaped hills that spread around 50&nbsp;square kilometers. Their height varies between 30&nbsp;to&nbsp;120&nbsp;meters. The hills are covered with grass, and they acquire their “chocolatey” tone during the dry season, and the grass dries and turns into giant “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chocolate</a>.”</p><p><h2>9. Darvaza Gas Crater, Turkmenistan</h2></p><p>This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unique </a>place is&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to, by&nbsp;the locals, as&nbsp;“The Gates of&nbsp;Hell” and it’s located in&nbsp;the Karakum Desert of&nbsp;Turkmenistan. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;reported that this crater <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>measures </a>about 230 feet across and 65&nbsp;feet deep.

Reynisfjara Beach, Iceland</h2></p><p>Reynisfjara is&nbsp;a&nbsp;volcanic black sand beach located on&nbsp;the South Coast of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Iceland data-link=tag>Iceland</a>.

And the HBO series was actually shot in&nbsp;this unique place. This scenery is&nbsp;known for its unique geology and its high rock stacks and black sand.</p><p><h2>11. Christmas Island, Australia</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/50d/739/1db6285eb69ba2836e8bf3a011.jpg><p>This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>island </a>located in&nbsp;the Indian Ocean is&nbsp;the setting for one of&nbsp;the most unique and colorful animal migrations in&nbsp;the world. In&nbsp;November of&nbsp;each year, around 50&nbsp;million red crabs migrate to&nbsp;this island and turn this landscape into an&nbsp;unusual sightseeing experience. The migration occurs so&nbsp;the crabs can breed and then release the eggs into the sea.</p><p>Now it’s time for you to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us which places blow your mind.
