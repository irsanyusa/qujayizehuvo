Lack of commitment</h3><p class=align-left>A healthy relationship involves two committed <a href=#>people</a>. If your girlfriend suddenly becomes uncommitted to the relationship, she could be cheating. However, the commitment level depends on the length of the relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d4bbf74c73a12ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 fun games to play with your boyfriend or girlfriend when bored</span></p></a><h3 id=1582824-2-secretiveness class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Secretiveness</h3><p class=align-left>People who are cheating are secretive. They do not want their partners to know what they are up to on social media and life in general. If your girlfriend starts hiding things on <a href=#>social media</a> or daily life, they may be a cheater.</p><h3 id=1582824-3-sudden-change-in-her-social-life class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. Sudden change in her social life</h3><p class=align-left>If you and your partner spend a lot of time together, then suddenly she changes her social routine, there could be a problem. If you find it hard to spend time together during your free time, it could be a sign she is looking for a new boyfriend.</p><h3 id=1582824-4-loss-of-interest-in-romance class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Loss of interest in romance</h3><p class=align-left>A thriving relationship is full of romance. Both partners know each other's love language and strive to satisfy each other with romantic gestures. If you notice a sudden lack of interest in the romance department, your girlfriend may be seeing someone else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4596a47057ebfa91.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Topics to chat with a girl on WhatsApp that are fun for both parties</span></p></a><h3 id=1582824-5-she-comes-home-late-and-with-no-explanation class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. She comes home late and with no explanation</h3><p class=align-left>A cheating girlfriend has a habit of coming home late with no explanations. She could be hanging out with friends in the club. When you ask her why she is late, she becomes elusive and vague about her whereabouts.</p><h3 id=1582824-6-constant-fights class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6. Constant fights</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d4bbf74c73a12ad.jpg><p class=align-left>One way to express dissatisfaction in the relationship is by picking unwarranted fights. If she starts picking fights she would otherwise not pick, she could be seeing someone else. Some women use these fights to discredit their relationships and justify their infidelity.</p><h3 id=1582824-7-telling-lies class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>7. Telling lies</h3><p class=align-left>One way to catch your cheating partner is if they are suddenly telling small white lies for no reason. When someone is unfaithful, they try to lie to match their story and timeline. The lies could be things they usually do quickly, start taking longer, and justify the sudden change.</p><h3 id=1582824-8-trust-issues class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>8. Trust issues</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d1e179890d9d446.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Right person, wrong time: 13 signs it might be happening to you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One sign of a cheating partner is that they have trust issues. The problems may involve being suspicious and blaming you for cheating when they know you haven't done anything. When your partner starts gaslighting you about cheating, they could be having an affair.</p><h3 id=1582824-9-she-is-constantly-on-the-phone class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>9. She is constantly on the phone</h3><p class=align-left>A cheating partner is always on her phone. She continuously sends <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1159743-text-messages-smile.html href=#>text messages</a> and makes calls to unknown people. When called, she leaves the room to have a conversation. A cheating girlfriend hardly puts her phone down because someone is keeping her busy.</p><h3 id=1582824-10-she-is-too-busy class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>10. She is too busy</h3><p class=align-left>A healthy relationship involves spending time with your partner. If you used to spend time with your girlfriend, then now she is too busy. This could mean she is cheating. Lack of time means you don't value that person.</p><h3 id=1582824-11-she-is-distracted class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>11. She is distracted</h3><p class=align-left>Distraction and lack of concentration in relationships are signs of being busy with someone. If the person distracting them is not you, it's someone else. She may have lost interest in anything you say or do and may even want to cut off any connection with you. If she is always engrossed in her phone and her mind seems far away all the time, she is cheating with someone else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6f14ed32e93287d6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 common deal breakers in a relationship nobody should tolerate</span></p></a><h3 id=1582824-12-she-doesn39t-invite-places-anymore class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>12. She doesn't invite places anymore</h3><p class=align-left>You must be careful if your better half spends more time with her friends and hardly invites you to join her. This is more so if the two of you always hang out with her friends, and then suddenly, she leaves you hanging. It could be she fears that her friends could say something to you regarding her affair.</p><h3 id=1582824-13-she-gets-bored class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>13. She gets bored</h3><p class=align-left>If your lady suddenly gets bored by anything you do, she is over you. A bored woman would rather sit on the couch and binge-watch a boring <a href=#>TV series</a> or movie to avoid you. If your dinners have become silent and she is no longer excited to see you, she has someone else.</p><h3 id=1582824-14-she-no-longer-includes-you-in-her-plans class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>14. She no longer includes you in her plans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4596a47057ebfa91.jpg><p class=align-left>Couples in a healthy relationship plan things together.

Expressions of dissatisfaction</h3><p class=align-left>The expression of dissatisfaction is a good sign in a relationship when done positively. However, when she constantly says she is dissatisfied with you or expresses her feelings negatively, she is cheating. She may tell you to leave her alone and not want to resolve the issue.</p><h3 id=1582824-16-lack-of-emotional-and-physical-intimacy class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>16. Lack of emotional and physical intimacy</h3><p class=align-left>Women are big on emotional and physical intimacy, which is a way for them to connect. Therefore, if she is not emotionally connected to you, then it could mean she is seeking intimacy elsewhere. Moreover, a lack of physical interest is an indicator she could be having an affair.</p><h3 id=1582824-17-she-is-not-responsible-for-her-actions class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>17. She is not responsible for her actions</h3><p class=align-left>If you catch your girlfriend in a situation and she dismisses your concerns when confronted, it may be a sign of cheating. She may gaslight you and guilt-trip you for no reason. Her failure to internalise guilt or shame means she doesn't care.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c97821d423923f8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best touching love messages to make him cry long distance</span></p></a><h3 id=1582824-18-she-seems-unhappy-in-the-relationship class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>18.

You may notice your girlfriend's eyes never light up when they see you; her attitude has changed, and she always seems unhappy.</p><h3 id=1582824-19-gut-instinct class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>19. Gut instinct</h3><p class=align-left>One of the very first signs that your girlfriend is cheating is your gut feeling. This is the inner voice telling you all is not well with her. Your gut feeling or instinct is solid when it comes to infidelity. It can sense when something in your relationship is off.</p><h3 id=1582824-20-she-hides-her-phone class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>20. She hides her phone</h3><p class=align-left>Most couples who <a href=#>love and trust</a> each other do not hide phones from each other.
