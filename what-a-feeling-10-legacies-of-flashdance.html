I wore it to one of the auditions, and they liked it.”<i></i></p><p>The torn garment became a fashion must-have for women, who often wore it with one shoulder exposed, a la Beals. You couldn’t go to a gym without seeing women dressed like Beals with ripped-collar sweatshirts and leggings – probably doing aerobic exercises to the sounds of Michael Sembello’s “Maniac,” from the Flashdance soundtrack, to boot. Soon, the off-the-shoulder look expanded to everyday-wear,(some boutiques would rip your T-shirt collar for you for a small fee), suitable for secretaries and teenage girls. The look was a precursor to the layered, punk-ish, artfully-ragged thrift shop look soon to be popularized by Cyndi Lauper and Madonna.</p><p class=next-item><span>Next</span> <a href=#>Adrian Lyne’s Directing Career</a></p><ul class="full-list group col-1"><li class=item-list><h3>Flashdance Legacies</h3></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pe7W1zJ5lnKedZH9xfZJoZ21nYWp8uLTArWSaZZaasq21zaBkamhdobKorcKinKxln5t6p7jArJ%2BdmZ6YsnC%2Fy6Kbnmeinr2xscNmqqGnpaGxpr6MqKVmm5ykwam1zaBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./virgin-islands-a-rum-go.html><span>←</span><span>Virgin Islands: A Rum Go</span></a>
