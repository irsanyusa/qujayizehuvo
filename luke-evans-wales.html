“I’ll always love Barafundle Bay in Pembrokeshire, and not only because I like saying 'Barafundle', which is a magnificent word,” he says. “It’s a perfect, private little beach, hemmed in by sand dunes and pine trees, where you can take the dogs and make as much noise as you want.”
“Then there’s Three Cliffs Bay on the Gower Peninsula, with its ruined castle and wooded valley at the top,” adds Evans."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Despite this, it’s actually an experience in Wales that currently tops his bucket list.</p><p>“When I took part in Wales’ Year of the Sea promotional campaign, we did some filming from a light aircraft,” says Evans. “We followed the coastline south from Eryri (Snowdonia), and in the footage you could see porpoises and dolphins playing in <a href=#>Cardigan Bay</a>. I’m planning to take a boat trip to get a closer look – we’ve got one of Britain’s biggest populations of bottlenose dolphins out there!”</p><p>Hopefully finding them won’t require any stops for directions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifK21xZ6qrbGcmnyttdWipaBnnKq4pnnEr5inq12srq2x0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-5-kinds-of-food-to-break-your-fast-with.html><span>←</span><span>The best 5 kinds of food to break your fast with</span></a>
