So with the launch of <a href=#>The Mandalorian</a>, Disney’s new Star Wars TV series now available on the <a href=#>Disney+ streaming service</a>, TIME is here to break down exactly how the show fits into the larger Star Wars timeline.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is The Mandalorian about?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Mandalorian stars Game of Thrones alum Pedro Pascal as a bounty hunter who hails from the planet Mandalor. In the tradition of his bounty hunter predecessors Jango and <a href=#>Boba Fett</a>, the unnamed Mandalorian is a helmeted <a href=# rel=noopener>“lone gunfighter”</a> who wears the traditional armor of his homeland. But that’s pretty much where the similarities end. While fan favorite Boba Fett was a clone raised by Jango who worked primarily for Jabba the Hutt during the Galactic Empire’s tyrannical rule, the Mandalorian operates in the chaotic outer reaches of the galaxy after the fall of the Empire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mandalorian-trailer-1.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s like after the Roman Empire falls, or when you don’t have a centralized shogun in Japan­ — and, of course, the Old West, when there wasn’t any government in the areas that had not yet been settled,” showrunner Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Lion King) told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Mandalorian also stars Gina Carano as Rebel Shock Trooper-turned-mercenary Cara Dune, Carl Weathers as bounty hunter guild leader Greef Carga, Giancarlo Esposito as former Imperial governor Moff Gideon and Taika Waititi as the voice of assassin droid IG-11.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When does The Mandalorian take place?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Favreau has said that The Mandalorian is set five years after the fall of the Empire in Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983) and 25 years before the rise of the First Order, the authoritarian regime that is firmly in control of the galaxy when Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015) begins.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In terms of Star Wars years, Return of the Jedi is set in 4 ABY (after the <a href=# rel=noopener>Battle of Yavin</a>) and The Force Awakens is set in 34 ABY, which means The Mandalorian takes place around 9 ABY. This is a period of time when the New Republic, the democratic government formed by the Rebel Alliance following their victory over the Empire, has only a tenuous hold on the galaxy — especially its lawless outskirts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mandalorian-trailer-18.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Favreau, The Mandalorian will explore some of the roots of the First Order. “You come in on Episode VII, [the First Order are] not just starting out. They’re pretty far along,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>EW</a>. “So somehow, things weren’t necessarily managed as well as they could have been if [the galaxy] ended up in hot water again like that.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How does ‘baby Yoda’ factor in?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the closing minutes of the first episode, the Mandalorian discovers that the bounty target that Werner Herzog’s unnamed character hired him to collect is a <a href=#>baby of Yoda’s species</a>. Well, a 50-year-old baby. Where exactly <a href=#>baby Yoda</a> — as fans have affectionately dubbed the big-eared, slow-aging alien — came from is still a mystery, but the fact that there are other members of Yoda’s species in the galaxy far, far away shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise. In the prequel movies, we were briefly introduced to <a href=# rel=noopener>Yaddle</a>, a female Yoda alien. So we know Yoda wasn’t the only one of his kind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, considering baby Yoda already has such a big target on his back, perhaps it means that he’s especially Force-sensitive compared to his fellow Yoda aliens. After all, he already managed to use the Force to save the Mandalorian from being killed by a space rhino.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZub2FshHSAjqaYp5yRobyztcCnZKyskad6uK3RrGStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deux-arretes-precisent-les-contenus-des-diplomes-nationaux-superieurs-de-comedien-et-de-musicien.html><span>←</span><span>Deux arrts prcisent les contenus des diplmes nationaux suprieurs de comdien et de musici</span></a>
