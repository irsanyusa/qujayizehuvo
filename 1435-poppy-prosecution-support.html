Emdadur Choudhury is part of the group Muslims Against Crusades, whose protest disrupted the annual two-minute silence with chants of ‘Burn, burn, British soldiers, British soldiers, burn in hell’. Explaining his decision to prosecute Choudhury, District Judge Howard Riddle said that the extremist’s act was a ‘calculated and deliberate insult to the dead and those who mourn or remember them’.</p><p>Notwithstanding, some have criticised the punishment for being too lenient, a sentiment which David Cameron seemed to echo when he said that he understood people who think that ‘we should be making a stronger statement that that sort of behaviour is completely out of order’.</p><p>However, the £50 fine was supported by the senior judge in charge of policy and sentencing in England and Wales, who defended the decision as carefully balancing the offence caused against the nation’s right to free speech.</p><p><a href=#>See the survey details and full results here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpZGiCbrzOqaeyZaCnvLSxwq6roqeeYsC2vM%2Boqa0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nielsen-top-10-ratings-streaming-april-22-1236020589.html><span>←</span><span>Nielsen Streaming Top 10: White Collar Joins the Chart Three Weeks After Netflix Debut,</span></a>
