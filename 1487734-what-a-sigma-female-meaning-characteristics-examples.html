To be independent means that you are not subject to being controlled by others. A sigma woman always relies on herself in everything she does. She does not need anyone's approval to do whatever she wants. This trait makes her admired by people around her. She stands up for what she believes and does not shy away from doing what she believes is right.</p><p class=align-left>They are admired and respected by males; however other men who cannot handle an independent woman might despise them. Moreover, she does not base her happiness on anything or anyone. She can be happy as a single woman or in a relationship.</p><h4>2.

She makes people respect her wherever she goes because of her trait of speaking truthfully as much as possible.</p><h4>7. She is not judgmental</h4><p class=align-left>Many people judge celebrities based on what they hear from other people. However, a sigma woman is different and doesn't make assumptions/opinions about someone based on rumours. She can't make judgments about a person she doesn't know well. She believes that you can only make judgments about a particular person if you take your time to learn about them instead of basing your judgments on rumours.</p><h4>8. Nobody pushes her around</h4><p class=align-left>She believes she was created to be a winner; if she loses, that does not break her; instead, she uses that as a lesson to make her do great things next time. She does not need anyone to give her lectures or tell her what she is capable of doing. This is because she is the driver of her life and knows <a href=#>what is best for her</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f735eadd2efb624a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing sister quotes to share with your favourite sibling</span></p></a><h4>9.

She doesn't care what other people think of her fashion or taste as long as she is happy and comfortable with herself.</p><h4>10. She will pay back if you double-cross her</h4><p class=align-left>She is peaceful and gets along with people.

She hates disagreements and conflicts and does whatever is possible to avoid such situations that will make her vengeful.</p><h4>11. They are mysterious</h4><p class=align-left>She is hard to read and understand. For this reason, people fear interacting with them because they don't know what is running on their minds. However, this trait also makes them interesting and draws a lot of attention because people want to know more about them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best tips on how to get a girlfriend</span></p></a><h4>12. They do things at their own pace</h4><p class=align-left>They hate working under pressure or doing things out of pressure from society or the people around them. They like setting their own pace in whatever they do. This trait makes them happy because sometimes, pressure regarding relationships, marriage, careers, and family life can all be overwhelming.</p><h4>13. She never settles for less in a relationship</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/414cb18ced7b0106_b.png><p class=align-left>She is picky when it comes to their partner.
