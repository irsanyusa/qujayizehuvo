With an <a href=#>all-new format</a>, promising more reveals and cutthroat eliminations, along with a whopping 22 contestants, anything can happen. And knowing The Masked Singer, it will!</strong></p><p id=block-ec54152b-1089-49da-a7f2-8064eee228ac>So let’s take a look at one of the singers who took the stage in the season premiere, the Harp. We’ll break down what we know about the costume and who the celebrity underneath could be.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjPsGnG26z0</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 8</h2><p>On The Masked Singer‘s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, they released a clue for the Harp and it was sheet music! Then, in the <a href=#>season premiere clues</a>, we learned a lot about the celebrity under the mask. Harp starts by saying “I am telling you, life has a funny way of putting you where you need to be.” She gets into her story, saying that when she was a teenager, she “auditioned for the biggest show in the world.” It was her dream, she says while making prayer hands, but she didn’t fit the mold and was turned down.&nbsp;</p><p>The Harp was seeing crying, but then said she kept going and it was her “uniqueness” that gave her the opportunity of a lifetime. One of the Men in Black is seen holding up a piece of paper that said “CAST ROLES LEAD 1: HARP!” She’s seen dancing, then gets roses from one of the Men in Black wearing a witch’s hat. Harp ends the clues by saying “the no’s in my life made me stronger,” then she flexes and someone walks up wearing 3D glasses.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Harp</h2><p>After her first performance and clues, Robin thought the Harp could be Queen Latifah. Jenny guessed this could be Jordin Sparks or Fantasia, and Ken built off that, guessing Jennifer Hudson.</p><p id=block-adeca979-196e-403e-bb95-1765dad45339>Because the clip of her singing was posted ahead of the premiere, fans online are going wild with guesses about who could be under the Harp mask. The season 8 guessing game has officially begun! The most popular predictions have been for Fantasia, Amber Riley, Tamar Braxton, Ester Dean, Alicia Keys, and Christina Milian.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘THE MASKED SINGER’ RETURNS WITH THRILLING FORMAT TWISTS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Harp on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-4f540236-784e-4f7a-a2cc-07e1b50dc01b>Like many online, I felt like I recognized that voice right away.

And Amber Riley’s voice is just too recognizable! The Harp’s costume is also pretty form-fitting, so gives away her figure as well.</p><p>Harp mentioned she auditioned for “the biggest show in the world” as a teenager but was shut down, and Amber Riley auditioned for <a href=#>American Idol</a> at 17. Her “opportunity of a lifetime” was getting cast in the show Glee. Throughout the package, she makes a lot of nods to solos she had on Glee. She said “I am telling you,” referring to the Dreamgirls song she performed on the show and on the West End. She flexed as an ode to “Stronger” by <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>, which she sang on the show. And her praying hands could be pointing to “Livin’ on a Prayer,” another song she solo’ed.</p><p>The last few clues that gave Amber Riley away were the 3D glasses, an homage to Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, and the witch hat. Amber played the Good Witch of the North in NBC’s The Wiz Live! She also recorded tracks for the Straight Outta Oz visual album by season 6’s <a href=#>Bull</a>, <a href=#>Todrick Hall</a>!</p><p>Finally, Amber Riley has been on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With the Stars</a>, which she won in 2013, so she’s no stranger to competition shows. More recently, she appeared on an episode of Celebrity Wheel of Fortune with none other than season one contestant and season 8 guest judge, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donny Osmond</a>! The Masked Singer is right up her alley and after taking out the competition in the <a href=#>season premiere</a>, she has a real chance to win!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_JohnLegend_CamilaCabello_GwenStefani_BlakeShelton_Tyler-GoldenNBC.jpg alt="Blake Shelton’s Inappropriate Comment to Camila Cabello You Might Have Missed on ‘The Voice’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer season 8</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZiWv7F7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./entree-en-vigueur-du-ceta-quel-va-etre-limpact-pour-les-territoires.html><span>←</span><span>quel va tre l'impact pour les territoires ?</span></a>
