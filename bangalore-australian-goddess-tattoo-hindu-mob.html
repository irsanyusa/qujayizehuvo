Religious hard-liners who insist India is a Hindu nation (rather than officially secular as its constitution states) have become emboldened in the face of lackluster government opposition.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the Deccan Chronicle newspaper, several members of the crowd that threatened Gordon and his girlfriend on Monday <a href=# rel=noopener>belong</a> to Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I studied in a school in Kodaikanal [a hill town about 300 miles from Bangalore] and I love India, which is why we came back to visit,” Gordon told the Chronicle, adding that he also has a tattoo of another Hindu deity — elephant-headed Lord Ganesha — on his back.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We have heard about the growing Hindu nationalism, but nothing justifies the way we were treated,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtaGdugHN8jpuYp5%2BRobyzsYyarKysopa5qq3NZp6onJSawLR505qrraefYrWqusOuZKankmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./25-genius-inventions-you-can-use-to-solve-problems-you-face-every-day-800275.html><span>←</span><span>25+ Genius Inventions You Can Use to Solve Problems You Face Every Day</span></a>
