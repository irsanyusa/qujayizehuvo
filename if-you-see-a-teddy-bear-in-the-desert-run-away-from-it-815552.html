But among these sands, you can meet dangerous and sometimes creepy creatures. Some of&nbsp;them can only cause health problems, but some can stay in&nbsp;your memory forever. Let’s get to&nbsp;know them, starting with dangerous ones and finishing with real nightmares.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ee8/903/0342e85a5b866bc0788482859d.png><p>So, you’re walking through a&nbsp;desert and see a&nbsp;big teddy bear with open hands. You understand that it’s probably a&nbsp;mirage, but still, you come closer. You were right. It’s not a&nbsp;plush toy but a&nbsp;giant cactus. There’s something strange about&nbsp;it. Thanks to&nbsp;some strange fluff, the branches resemble the arms of&nbsp;a&nbsp;teddy bear. However, this is&nbsp;not fluff but thousands of&nbsp;thin needles. And they are the reason you shouldn’t come closer. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The cactus is&nbsp;called the jumping cholla or&nbsp;teddy bear cholla</a>. It&nbsp;grows in&nbsp;the desert areas of&nbsp;Arizona and in&nbsp;the northern part of&nbsp;Mexico. Don’t worry, this cactus won’t attack you, but it&nbsp;will cling to&nbsp;your <a href=# title=skin data-link=tag>skin</a> or&nbsp;<a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> if&nbsp;you touch&nbsp;it.</p><p>Such a&nbsp;“fur coat” protects the cactus from <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a>, creates shade, and saves it&nbsp;from heat. The lateral branches are the most important parts of&nbsp;the plant as&nbsp;they carry out photosynthesis and accumulate a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;moisture inside. So, despite all the danger, the cactus can be&nbsp;helpful for desert wanderers. And the danger here is&nbsp;needles. If&nbsp;you look closer at&nbsp;them, you will see they have the shape of&nbsp;hooks. One touch, and hundreds of&nbsp;thorns are already in&nbsp;your finger. It’s pretty difficult to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them, and the needles cause unpleasant painful sensations.</p><p>But the coolest thing about this cactus is&nbsp;the way it&nbsp;reproduces. The plant clones itself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new place. When animals and people pass the jumping cholla and touch&nbsp;it, the cactus gives them a&nbsp;small piece of&nbsp;itself along with the needles. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you throw this piece to&nbsp;the ground, it&nbsp;takes root and starts growing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f14/3fd/e8369b51408d87cac4331bf310.png><p>The degree of&nbsp;danger is&nbsp;rising. The next monster from the desert is&nbsp;running toward&nbsp;us. And that is...<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>an ostrich</a>. Many think these animals are cowards hiding their heads in&nbsp;the sand. You will most likely change your mind if&nbsp;you’re unlucky enough to&nbsp;meet one.</p><p>Usually, ostriches are not aggressive, but you should run if&nbsp;you come closer to&nbsp;their nest. On&nbsp;the other hand, you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that because ostriches move at&nbsp;a&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;forty-three miles per hour. You need a&nbsp;<a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a> to&nbsp;get away from them. They run and hit their enemy with their chests. There have been cases when ostriches attacked vans and caused significant damage to&nbsp;them.</p><p>But the main danger these birds present is&nbsp;their powerful legs with sharp claws. They can deliver strong blows with them and even beat a&nbsp;prone opponent. So&nbsp;yes, if&nbsp;you see an&nbsp;ostrich in&nbsp;the distance, go&nbsp;the other way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c81/43a/c54d5e5ba4a64581ee86c3e600.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>This small spotted lizard lives</a> underground almost all the time in&nbsp;the arid deserts of&nbsp;the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico. Sometimes, it&nbsp;goes outside to&nbsp;find lunch. It&nbsp;only seems cute, but in&nbsp;fact, it’s a&nbsp;dangerous Gila monster. Its thick skin protects the reptile from hawks, coyotes, and other predators. But its main protection is&nbsp;its <a href=# title=venom data-link=tag>venom</a>.</p><p>Snakes and spiders inject their toxins using long needle-like fangs. The Gila Monster clamps down and chews the prey to&nbsp;spread the venom. And when it&nbsp;bites a&nbsp;person, it&nbsp;can keep its jaws closed for a&nbsp;long time. Getting rid of&nbsp;the animal is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tricky feat. People who have experienced the effects of&nbsp;the venom say it&nbsp;feels as&nbsp;if&nbsp;hot magma passes through the veins. Despite this, the lizard turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;useful for science. Doctors used its venom to&nbsp;create medicines for <a href=# title=diabetes data-link=tag>diabetes</a> and obesity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/924/30d/3b82235a3a977f7763a074e92e.png><p>The time has come. Now you’re about to&nbsp;meet one of&nbsp;the creepiest creatures living in&nbsp;the desert. Be&nbsp;quiet and listen to&nbsp;the silence. Stand still. There’s no&nbsp;one around. Suddenly, you hear some hissing coming from below. You lower your head and see&nbsp;it. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;big yellow spider the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;human palm</a> with strong jaws and long legs hides in&nbsp;the shadow of&nbsp;your body.</p><p>In&nbsp;horror, you run away from this monster, but it&nbsp;goes after you. It&nbsp;isn’t easy to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;this situation, but try to&nbsp;calm down. The creature isn’t interested in&nbsp;you. It&nbsp;wants only your shadow to&nbsp;hide from the scorching sun. Anyway, it’s better not to&nbsp;touch&nbsp;it. The powerful jaws of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Camel spider</a> can cause unpleasant sensations, to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;mildly. And by&nbsp;the way, this creature isn’t really a&nbsp;spider. Yeah, it&nbsp;belongs to&nbsp;the class of&nbsp;arachnids, but it’s a&nbsp;separate species&nbsp;— solpugid.</p><p>It&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;bite. It’s fearless and pretty aggressive. The spider preys on&nbsp;insects, lizards, rodents, and small birds. It&nbsp;can also move at&nbsp;a&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;ten miles per hour. For their small size, this is&nbsp;very fast. You need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional athlete to&nbsp;run away from&nbsp;it. Most often, you can find camel spiders in&nbsp;the deserts of&nbsp;the Middle East, but they also live in&nbsp;Mexico and the southwestern U.S.</p><p>These runners are nocturnal and try to&nbsp;avoid the sun during the day, so&nbsp;they are always hunting your shadow. By&nbsp;the way, they got their name because they often hide in&nbsp;the shadows of&nbsp;camels. You won’t hide from them during the day, but they will also want to&nbsp;come after you at&nbsp;night, especially if&nbsp;you make a&nbsp;fire. Solpugids always run to&nbsp;the light in&nbsp;the hope of&nbsp;eating something. Some species of&nbsp;these spiders make a&nbsp;hissing sound to&nbsp;scare their enemies away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9ba/737/4630d65c31ba56c64fd4aa98f1.png><p>Now let’s calm down for a&nbsp;second and leave the hot desert. We’re going into the humid tropics of&nbsp;Tanzania. Under tree bark, fallen leaves, and in&nbsp;dark caves, you can meet one of&nbsp;the most terrifying creatures on&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;tailless whip scorpion</a>. Imagine a&nbsp;big scorpion without a&nbsp;tail with a&nbsp;flat body that looks like it&nbsp;has been pressed by&nbsp;something. It’s similar to&nbsp;spiders but has no&nbsp;venom glands and can’t spin a&nbsp;web.</p><p>This monster is&nbsp;silent and fast. But the scariest thing is&nbsp;its two front claws, twice as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;the creature itself. Any prey it&nbsp;catches will never escape. Life in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark cave has spoiled its eyesight, so&nbsp;the whip scorpion tries to&nbsp;avoid sunlight. During molting, it&nbsp;climbs up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the ceiling and slowly comes out of&nbsp;its old skin. Imagine directing your flashlight there and seeing small cocoons out of&nbsp;which pale spiders with excessively long legs crawl.</p><p>If&nbsp;you really meet&nbsp;it, be&nbsp;calm and slowly go&nbsp;away as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible. Be&nbsp;careful. The flat scorpion can crawl under your clothes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;second and bite you in&nbsp;the stomach. And that’s not the worst part... Okay, this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;joke. This pretty guy is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the shiest and most harmless creatures among spiders and scorpions. It’s afraid of&nbsp;you and will never attack.</p><p>Many consider it&nbsp;beautiful and keep whip scorpions in&nbsp;glass terrariums. If&nbsp;you want such a&nbsp;pet, carefully watch it&nbsp;so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;doesn’t run away from its house. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;happens, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;pretty challenging to&nbsp;catch it&nbsp;again. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;moments, it&nbsp;can get under your bed or&nbsp;go&nbsp;through gaps in&nbsp;the floor. Then it’ll go&nbsp;to&nbsp;your neighbor’s apartment through a&nbsp;ventilation system and scare people there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fd6/2ce/633210555bba82a4bffd784916.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Okay, how about one more scorpion</a>? It’s not as&nbsp;creepy as&nbsp;the other creatures in&nbsp;this video, but it’s the most venomous scorpion in&nbsp;the USA. This is&nbsp;the Arizona Bark Scorpion. The problem is&nbsp;that you can see it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the desert, in&nbsp;your home, or&nbsp;in&nbsp;the yard.</p><p>These dangerous venomous beasts crawl into rooms and often sting people. One time is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;cause pain, similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bee sting. But someone with an&nbsp;allergy may experience paralysis, breathing problems, and other health issues.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorGarlZp6onnTnpudsV2XsqK%2BjKKlZqyYmnqlsdKeqa1loqq7bq3WmrBmnqKkum6102Zvam1lan9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julia-louis-dreyfus-funny-naked.html><span>←</span><span>Funny Naked Celebrities: Julia Louis-Dreyfus GQ Photo Part of Trend</span></a>
