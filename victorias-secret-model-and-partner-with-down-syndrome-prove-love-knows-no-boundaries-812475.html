Her striking beauty and infectious personality have shattered stereotypes and proven that anything is&nbsp;possible. Born with <a href=# title="Down syndrome" data-link=tag>Down syndrome</a>, Sofía was told by&nbsp;many that she would never achieve her dreams. But she refused to&nbsp;be&nbsp;defined by&nbsp;her diagnosis and instead chose to&nbsp;pursue her passion for modeling. And now, the lovely model has found a&nbsp;boyfriend.</p><p><h2>Sofía Jirau and her boyfriend, Chris González, show&nbsp;us what a&nbsp;cute couple looks like.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/317/3d4/ff8732555896553f8d74133025.jpg><p>Despite having grown up&nbsp;with Down syndrome, González and Jirau are showing the world what they’re made&nbsp;of. González is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>entrepreneur</a>, while Jirau is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stunning <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>model</a>, and both of&nbsp;them are on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission to&nbsp;prove that there are no&nbsp;limits to&nbsp;what they can achieve. Their dedication and hard work have paid off, and they’ve already made history in&nbsp;their fields by&nbsp;setting some seriously smart goals.</p><p>The fabulous Sofía Jirau <a href=#>became</a> the first woman with Down syndrome to&nbsp;be&nbsp;featured in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Victoria’s Secret <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Love Cloud</a> collection campaign. At&nbsp;just 25&nbsp;years old, she’s already <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>making</a> waves in&nbsp;the modeling industry and inspiring others to&nbsp;follow their dreams. In&nbsp;fact, since she started modeling in&nbsp;2020, she’s been a&nbsp;shining example of&nbsp;how <a href=# title=perseverance data-link=tag>perseverance</a> and hard work can help you overcome any obstacle.</p><p><h2>The lovely couple is&nbsp;breaking all barriers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/007/d7b/5183da5afc909f94139b199ee2.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;tell the whole world that people with my&nbsp;condition, Down syndrome, inside and out, we&nbsp;have no&nbsp;limits,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>. “People who have Down syndrome like me&nbsp;are capable of&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;job, creating their own business, and working hard like&nbsp;me.”</p><p>And let’s not forget about Chris González, the other half of&nbsp;this amazing power couple. In&nbsp;2014, he&nbsp;made history by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>becoming</a> the first person with Down syndrome in&nbsp;Puerto Rico to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>obtain</a> a&nbsp;driver’s license (according to&nbsp;his parents). But that’s not all&nbsp;— he’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>also</a> a&nbsp;skilled chef, a&nbsp;talented barista, and a&nbsp;successful <a href=# title=entrepreneur data-link=tag>entrepreneur</a> with his very own food truck. With so&nbsp;many incredible accomplishments under his belt, it’s clear that González is&nbsp;a&nbsp;true trailblazer who refuses to&nbsp;let anything hold him back.</p><p><h2>And the power couple also runs a&nbsp;campaign.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/119/4cf/e9b1c55072bab0567a540fa179.jpg><p>Chris González and Sofía Jirau are teaming up&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;difference</a> and inspire others through their incredible campaign called “Sin Límites” (or&nbsp;“Without Limits” in&nbsp;English). This dynamic duo is&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission to&nbsp;raise awareness about the Down syndrome community and to&nbsp;demonstrate that anything is&nbsp;possible with hard work and determination.</p><p>People recognize Jirau on&nbsp;the street and often stop to&nbsp;take pictures with her because of&nbsp;her growing fame. And when talking about her busy schedule, the lovely model explained that, to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;with her busy lifestyle, she hits the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gym</a> for an&nbsp;hour 5&nbsp;days a&nbsp;week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fcd/34d/1f7abc5f8487e46a87f871275d.jpg><p>Their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> has been described in&nbsp;the past as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;love at&nbsp;first sight. Although Jirau and González have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kept quiet</a> about their relationship since early 2022, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;indication that they have split up&nbsp;or&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;anytime soon.</p><p>Don’t leave&nbsp;us so&nbsp;soon!
